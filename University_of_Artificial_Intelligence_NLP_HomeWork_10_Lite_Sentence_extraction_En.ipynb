            "         1 Weight loss for obese populations has been a challenging subject. There are numerous mobile applications to address weight loss, but the low retention rate is a barrier for the intervention. This is a retrospective study, aiming to investigate the effectiveness of financial incentives to achieve weight loss via a monetary reimbursement model on a smartphone application. Participants voluntarily purchased a 16-week mobile weight loss application program, and those who logged food intake three times a day received monetary reimbursement up to the full amount they initially paid. We analyzed health-related information and logged in-app activities from participants (N = 2,803) including age, sex, weight, food intake, and physical activity on their mobile healthcare application called Noom from January 2017 to April 2019. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare differences between groups who succeeded and failed at food logging, controlling for baseline BMI. The ANCOVA found that participants who completed the food logging successfully for 16 weeks (N = 1,565) lost significantly more weight than those who failed food logging (N = 1,238, F = 56.0, p < 0.001). In addition, participants who were able to log their food intake successfully exercised more (F = 41.5, p < 0.001), read more in-app articles (F = 120.7, p < 0.001), and consumed more quantity of healthy foods (F = 12.8, p < 0.001). Monetary reimbursement is an effective tool for weight reduction by encouraging participants to monitor their health-related behaviors regularly.\n",
            "         29 In this study, we examined the effectiveness of a monetary incentive with a deposit system for Noom application users (N = 2,803) to lose weight. As a result, 55.8% of them logged their food consumption three times a day for 16 weeks, and they lost significantly more weight than those who failed food logging during the same period (2.96% vs. 2.06% of initial weight loss). In addition, the former group spent significantly more time working out, read significantly more health-related articles and consumed healthy foods more than the latter group.\n",
            "         31 To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated the effectiveness of a monetary incentive for a mobile weight loss program adapting the deposit contract model. Prior studies examining the efficacy of using incentives to promote weight loss were conducted only in face-to-face interventions. Running an in-person reimbursement model usually requires human resources in terms of assigning tasks, keeping track of behaviors, and implementing incentive. The smartphone application environment can offer easier and efficient ways to communicate with participants and operate the reimbursement model. Thus, this study adds value to the literature by examining the efficiency and effectiveness of the reimbursement model on the mobile application platform for healthy lifestyle intervention.\n",
            "         35 In conclusion, we demonstrated preliminary utility of a smartphone application for weight reduction in the form of monetary reimbursement from a large number of participants. Participants in this study voluntarily purchased the application to lose weight, which is consistent with individuals who use smartphone applications for healthcare, making this study generalizable to populations of weight loss application users. In future studies, evaluation of specific behavioral changes (e.g., specific change of portion/contents of meal, change of workout length/frequency/contents), continued engagement of new behaviors after the intervention, post-program weight loss without monetary reimbursement, and utility for clinical populations, will be necessary.\n",
            "         44 We compared the differences in the baseline characteristics between the mission success and mission failure group using a t-test. We assessed the effectiveness of monetary incentives for weight loss using ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) between the two groups. The values of the baseline BMI were entered as a covariate. We also compared the differences of the secondary outcomes by ANCOVA controlling for baseline BMI.\n",

            "         47 Dermatomyositis (DM) is frequently complicated by interstitial lung disease (ILD), which increases mortality. This study aims to elucidate the clinical significance of nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) on assessing the disease activity and prognosis of DM-ILD. We compared the NVC findings between anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (anti-MDA5) antibody-positive and anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (anti-ARS) antibody-positive patients, the survival and ILD-related death groups, and examined the association of NVC findings with prognostic factors of DM-ILD. The median scores of microhemorrhage and capillary disorganization in the anti-MDA5 antibody-positive group were significantly higher than those in the anti-ARS antibody-positive group (P = 0.012 and 0.044, respectively). In contrast, the median scores of tortuous capillaries in the anti-ARS antibody-positive group were significantly higher than those in the anti-MDA5 antibody-positive group (P = 0.002). The median scores of microhemorrhage was significantly higher in the ILD-related death group than the survival group (P = 0.02). The scores of microhemorrhage, capillary disorganization, and neoangiogenesis correlated with known poor prognosis factors of DM-ILD. Additionally, the scores of microhemorrhage and capillary loss correlated significantly with the total fibrosis scores of chest high-resolution computed tomography. These findings suggest that NVC is a useful tool for assessing the disease activity and prognosis of DM-ILD.\n",
            "         50 Recently, the relationship between NVC findings and clinical features has been examined in connective tissue diseases other than SSc. Abnormal NVC findings are also seen in DM patients17. Myositis activity has been reported to correlate significantly with loss of capillaries on NVC findings in DM patients18. Kubo et al. reported a significant correlation between NVC findings and perivascular lymphocyte infiltrations in skin biopsies of DM patients19. However, NVC findings in DM-ILD has not been elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the relationship between NVC findings and clinical features in DM-ILD patients and evaluated the significance of NVC findings between anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 antibody and anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase antibody.\n",

            "         89 Optic nerve injury induces optic nerve degeneration and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death that lead to visual disturbance. In this study, we examined if topical ripasudil has therapeutic potential in adult mice after optic nerve crush (ONC). Topical ripasudil suppressed ONC-induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and ameliorated RGC death. In addition, topical ripasudil significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of collapsin response mediator protein 2 and cofilin, and promoted optic nerve regeneration. These results suggest that topical ripasudil promotes RGC protection and optic nerve regeneration by modulating multiple signaling pathways associated with neural cell death, microtubule assembly and actin polymerization.\n",
            "         90 Traumatic optic neuropathy is a common clinical problem that induces retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic nerve atrophy. Recent studies using an optic nerve crush (ONC) model in rodents have shown that neuroprotection and axon regeneration are promising strategies for the treatment of optic nerve injury1,2,3. One of the key molecular pathways that suppresses axon regeneration is the Rho/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling, which mediates the effects of myelin-associated axon growth inhibitors such as Nogo and repulsive guidance molecule4. Blocking Rho/ROCK signaling reversed the inhibitory effects of these molecules and stimulated axon regeneration and functional recovery in animal models of spinal cord injury5. In ONC models, intravitreal injections of two ROCK inhibitors, fasudil and Y-27632, showed different effects on optic nerve regeneration6,7. Y-27632 significantly promoted regeneration of rat and cat optic nerve fibers, whereas fasudil did not. These results suggest that efficacy of ROCK inhibitors in promoting axon regeneration is quite different among individual inhibitors.\n",
            "         91 Ripasudil is the first ophthalmic solution approved for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension in 2014, and its inhibitory effects are more potent than fasudil and Y-27632. Ripasudil lowers intraocular pressure (IOP) by altering the arrangement of cytoskeleton and focal adhesions in trabecular meshwork cells, which increases the outflow of the aqueous humor8,9. We previously reported that topical ripasudil prevents glaucomatous retinal degeneration10 in excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) knockout (KO) mice, a mouse model of normal tension glaucoma (NTG)11,12. Ripasudil strongly suppressed oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) that stimulates RGC death in EAAC1 KO mice10,13. These results suggest that ripasudil promotes RGC protection by stimulating both IOP-dependent and IOP-independent pathways. In addition, oral ripasudil partially prevented ONC-induced RGC death by suppressing oxidative stress via Nox1 downregulation14. In the present study, we examined the effects of topical ripasudil on RGC protection and axon regeneration using an ONC model.\n",
            "         92 Ripasudil protects RGCs after optic nerve injury\n",
            "         93 To investigate whether ripasudil protects RGCs following ONC, we topically administered daily ripasudil or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 14 days (Fig. 1a). To detect RGCs, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of the flat-mounted retina with an antibody against RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS). We divided the areas of the retina as shown in Fig. 1b for analysis. As shown in representative pictures (Fig. 1c), ONC severely decreased the RGC density, but ripasudil partially suppressed the RGC loss in the central, middle, and peripheral areas at day 7 (Fig. 1d–f). Similar protective effects were detected in all the area at day 14 (Fig. 1g–j). These data demonstrate that ripasudil prevents RGC death all across the retina following ONC.\n",

            "         99 As intravitreal injection of Y-27632 promoted regeneration of axons in rat and cat optic nerves6,7, we hypothesized that topical ripasudil may also have beneficial effects on optic nerve regeneration. Topical ripasudil or PBS was applied everyday after ONC and the regenerating axons of RGCs were traced by injecting cholera toxin β-subunit (CTB) into the vitreous at day 12 (d12) after ONC (Fig. 3a). Following ONC at d14, the number of regenerating axons in ripasudil-treated mice was greater than PBS-treated control mice (Fig. 3b). Quantitative analyses demonstrated that the number of regenerating axons that extended beyond 100 µm was 47 ± 10 in control and 110 ± 13 with ripasudil treatment, and beyond 250 µm was 25 ± 4 in control and 62 ± 8 with ripasudil treatment (Fig. 3c,d). In addition, 21 ± 3 axons regenerated over 500 µm in ripasudil-treated mice (Fig. 3e). These results suggest that topical ripasudil stimulates axon regeneration following ONC.\n",

            "         108 We next examined if topical ripasudil suppresses the phosphorylation of CRMP2 in the retina after ONC. For this purpose, we evaluated the protein levels of total CRMP2 and p-CRMP2 in the retinas after ONC with topical ripasudil or PBS treatment. We found that ripasudil significantly suppressed the ratio of p-CRMP2 to total CRMP2 compared with PBS at 3 h and 3 days, but not 7 days after ONC (Fig. 5a–f). We observed no marked changes in the protein levels of total CRMP2 in both groups. We also performed immunohistochemical analysis at 3 h after ONC and found that p-CRMP2 was observed in the inner retina in PBS-treated mice and double-labeled with RBPMS in the GCL (Fig. 5g). However, p-CRMP2 expression was suppressed in ripasudil-treated mice (Fig. 5g). Quantitative analyses confirmed that the phosphorylation of CRMP2 in the GCL is significantly suppressed with ripasudil treatment compared with PBS treatment (Fig. 5h). We also evaluated the protein levels of total cofilin and p-cofilin in the same retinas. We found that ripasudil significantly suppressed the ratio of p-cofilin compared with PBS at 3 h, 3 and 7 days after ONC (Fig. 6a–f). We observed no marked changes in the protein levels of total cofilin in both groups. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that p-cofilin was observed in the inner retina in PBS-treated mice, and its expression was suppressed in ripasudil-treated mice (Fig. 6g).

            "         116 In our study, the neuroprotective effect of ripasudil was modest considering the suppression rate of p-p38 in the retina. We previously reported that some RGC subtypes are highly tolerant to neurotoxicity and glaucoma-like degeneration in glaucoma model mice22. Subtype-specific susceptibility to RGC death is also observed after ONC23,24. These results suggest that some RGCs may be affected less by changes in p-p38, and that strong suppression of p-p38 by ripasudil may not directly lead to the effective RGC protection. In addition, the modest effects of ripasudil treatment on optic nerve regeneration in this study may be due to the route of administration (eye drops). Stronger effects may be achieved by intraocular injection6,7 or oral administration14 of ripasudil, but these methods may not be ideal for clinical practice. Moreover, one may consider that additional regenerating axons may be related to the extra survival RGCs, and that the effects of ripasudil on regeneration/extension of axons are questionable. However, regenerating axons were observed in the ripasudil treatment group at a site where there was hardly any regenerating axons in the control group (500 µm from the crush site), and as ripasudil affects phosphorylation of CRMP2 and cofilin, two of the molecules that are involved in regulation of axon regeneration, it is likely that topical ripasudil was able to increase the ability of axons to regenerate.\n",

We selected this dose of ripasudil because 2% is the concentration that can be stably dissolved without precipitation at normal temperature, and 2% ripasudil was effective for RGC protection in EAAC1 KO mice10. 2% ripasudil or PBS was administered 3 min after ONC. Once the surgery was completed, the mice were assigned identification numbers randomly so that the nature of treatment (vehicle or ripasudil) was masked to evaluators of the results.\n",

            "4 Influence of temperature on the electrochemical window of boron doped diamond: a comparison of commercially available electrodes\n",
            "         133 This work compares the electrochemical windows of polished and unpolished boron doped diamond (BDD) electrodes with hydrogen and oxygen terminations at a series of temperatures up to 125 °C. The experiment was run at 5 bar pressure to avoid complications due to bubble formation. An alternative method for determining the electrochemical window is compared to the most commonly used method, which defines the window at an arbitrary current density cut-off (Jcut-off) value. This arbitrary method is heavily influenced by the mass transport of the electrolyte and cannot be used to compare electrodes across literature where different Jcut-off values have been used. A linear fit method is described which is less affected by the experimental conditions in a given measurement system. This enables a more accurate comparison of the relative electrochemical window from various diamond electrode types from reported results. Through comparison of polished and unpolished BDD electrodes, with hydrogen and oxygen surface terminations, it is determined that the electrochemical window of BDD electrodes narrows as temperature increases; activation energies are reported.\n",
            "         134 Boron doped diamond (BDD) can act as an exceptional electrode material, with the widest electrochemical window of any known material—that is the potential range that can be applied across a working electrode before the onset of either oxidation or reduction of the electrolyte at its surface1,2. To date, there has not been a systematic study reported on how the electrochemical window of BDD is affected by temperature. This has particular relevance to the use of BDD electrodes that are employed in extreme environments, such as oil wells, where the electrode can be exposed to temperatures exceeding 150 °C3. This work aims to give an initial insight into how temperature impacts the electrochemical window of BDD electrodes.\n",

            "         178 This work has been an investigation into how the electrochemical window of BDD electrodes is affected by temperature and how the method used to determine the electrochemical window from experimental data can affect the apparent result. The experiment was run at 5 bar pressure to avoid complications due to bubble formation. For every electrode, the electrochemical windows became narrower as the temperature increased from 21 to 125 °C, which is to be expected since the redox reaction is thermally activated. The widest electrochemical windows were reported for the unpolished electrodes, which have a lower proportion of sp2 carbon at their surfaces in comparison to the polished electrodes. The influence on the ratio between sp2 and sp3 carbon at the electrode surfaces was shown to have a much more significant impact on the electrochemical window value reported than the hydrogen or oxygen termination of the diamonds.\n",

            "5 Ultrawide-angle and high-efficiency metalens in hexagonal arrangement\n",
            "         180 Wide-angle optical systems play a vital role in imaging applications and have been researched for many years. In traditional lenses, attaining a wide field of view (FOV) by using a single optical component is difficult because these lenses have crucial aberrations. In this study, we developed a wide-angle metalens with a numerical aperture of 0.25 that provided a diffraction-limited FOV of over 170° for a wavelength of 532 nm without the need for image stitching or multiple lenses. The designed wide-angle metalens is free of aberration and polarization, and its full width of half maximum is close to the diffraction limit at all angles. Moreover, the metalens which is designed through a hexagonal arrangement exhibits higher focusing efficiency at all angles than most-seen square arrangement. The focusing efficiencies are as high as 82% at a normal incident and 45% at an incident of 85°. Compared with traditional optical components, the proposed metalens exhibits higher FOV and provides a more satisfactory image quality because of aberration correction. Because of the advantages of the proposed metalens, which are difficult to achieve for a traditional single lens, it has the potential to be applied in camera systems and virtual and augmented reality.\n",
            "         183 Wide angle metalenses have been studied for several years. A method to achieve wide angle property is based on traditional bulk optical property by double metalens19,20. In such doublets, the diffraction-limited FOV is up to approximately 56°. By contrast, the FOV of a single-layer metalens21 is limited to 30° and has a low optical efficiency of 6–20%. Shalaginov et al. proposed an optical system design by using a single metalens22 to achieve large angle in the range of the infrared light wavelength. Based on the landscape lens configuration, we designed a wide-angle metalens for 532-nm wavelength by means of electromagnetic wave propagation and ray tracing. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) software from Lumerical Inc. is applied in combination with a geometrical optics design software from OpticStudio (Zemax, LLC). In our design, the metalens was designed to optimize Strehl ratios for all incident angles by using the damped least-squares method. The optimized phase profile can achieve diffraction-limited focusing at overlapping wide angles. Furthermore, to achieve high focusing efficiency and reduce the effect of the total reflection at large angles, we chose propagation phase type metasurface23,24,25 and used particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find most suitable nanostructure with a hexagonal arrangement. This arrangement led to a focusing efficiency of as high as 84% at normal incident light and of 45% even at 85° in 532 nm wavelength. Compared with the traditional square arrangement, hexagonal arrangement increases the focusing efficiency for the entire angle and is highly important in wide-angle performance.\n",
            "         202 We selected pillar nanostructures that exhibit axis symmetry to achieve polarisation-insensitive property, which is not influenced by polarisation. Moreover, because nanostructures can be considered truncated waveguides, nanostructures with different dimensions can be used to generate different effective refractive indices by changing their size to obtain different phase distributions. For each unit cell of aperiodic structures, previous researchers3,20,31 have assumed that the metasurface is locally periodic: scattering in any small region is almost the same as scattering acquired from a periodic surface. Thus, we calculated the phase delay and transmission through the unit cell structure by using the commercial FDTD software from Lumerical. To cover the entire 0 to 2π phase and achieve good efficiency through the unit cell, we used PSO to optimize nanostructures in different arrangements. We calculated each phase of each unit cell structure by extending their radius. The diameter of our nanostructure in square arrangement was 50–240 nm. Figure 4a presents the unit cell structure of the metalens and illustrates the radius and height of the nanostructure in square arrangement. The materials used for our substrate and metalens were SIO2 and GaN, respectively, whose indices were approximately 1.46 and 2.42, respectively, for the 532-nm wavelength. Figure 4b,c illustrates the phase delay and transmission of square unit cells. At a wide incident angle, total internal reflection (TIR) occurred. TIR is the phenomenon where all incident light is reflected off a boundary. To increase the efficiency of our designed wide-angle metalens, we employed the hexagonal arrangement for nanostructure construction. The main difference between the hexagonal grid and the square grid is that the hexagon grid could more efficiently fill planes with equal size units and does not waste space. Because of the high density of nanostructures, they can effectively reduce the effect of total internal reflection caused by dense (high refractive index) to loose (low refractive index) media. We accordingly choose our nanostructure diameter from 50 to 220 nm which maintain high transmitted energy and can be fabricated in the future. Figure 4d presents the hexagonal unit cell structure and top view of the metalens and illustrates the radius, unit cell, and height of the nanostructure. Figure 4e–f illustrates the transmission and phase delay of such nanostructures.\n",

The advantages of the designed wide-angle metalens, namely its ultrawide angle and high focusing efficiency in hexagon arrangement which nature prefers the most, should allow it to play a vital role in advancing the field of wide-angle optical systems and their applications.\n",
            "         225 This paper proposes an ultrawide-angle and high-efficiency metalens operating at a wavelength of 0.532 µm arranged through a hexagonal arrangement. By using a rigorous optical system design process, we developed a high-quality and high-efficiency panoramic metalens by using a single optical component. The results revealed that the FWHM of the proposed metalens approaches the diffraction limit at different angles, and the metalens is aberration-free and polarisation-free. Moreover, the focusing efficiencies at all the angles increased considerably because of the hexagonal grid, especially at wide angles. The proposed metalens provides a higher image quality without the need for a complex system and image stitching; Compared with other wide-angle designs, it simultaneously has wide-angle and high-efficiency optical properties at visible wavelength. The metalens exhibits the potential for multiple applications in fields, including optical technology, biomedical science, display technology, augmented reality, and virtual reality.\n",

            "6 Automated rotator cuff tear classification using 3D convolutional neural network\n",
            "         226 Rotator cuff tear (RCT) is one of the most common shoulder injuries. When diagnosing RCT, skilled orthopedists visually interpret magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan data. For automated and accurate diagnosis of RCT, we propose a full 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) based method using deep learning. This 3D CNN automatically diagnoses the presence or absence of an RCT, classifies the tear size, and provides 3D visualization of the tear location. To train the 3D CNN, the Voxception-ResNet (VRN) structure was used. This architecture uses 3D convolution filters, so it is advantageous in extracting information from 3D data compared with 2D-based CNNs or traditional diagnosis methods. MRI data from 2,124 patients were used to train and test the VRN-based 3D CNN. The network is trained to classify RCT into five classes (None, Partial, Small, Medium, Large-to-Massive). A 3D class activation map (CAM) was visualized by volume rendering to show the localization and size information of RCT in 3D. A comparative experiment was performed for the proposed method and clinical experts by using randomly selected 200 test set data, which had been separated from training set. The VRN-based 3D CNN outperformed orthopedists specialized in shoulder and general orthopedists in binary accuracy (92.5% vs. 76.4% and 68.2%), top-1 accuracy (69.0% vs. 45.8% and 30.5%), top-1±1 accuracy (87.5% vs. 79.8% and 71.0%), sensitivity (0.94 vs. 0.86 and 0.90), and specificity (0.90 vs. 0.58 and 0.29). The generated 3D CAM provided effective information regarding the 3D location and size of the tear. Given these results, the proposed method demonstrates the feasibility of artificial intelligence that can assist in clinical RCT diagnosis.\n",
            "         229 To overcome these problems, we propose a deep 3D-CNN method to classify rotator cuff tear (RCT), one of the most common shoulder injuries. RCT can be caused by the rupture of rotator cuff tendons, most frequently around the supraspinatus muscle, which causes pain and disability including weakness and decreased range of motion in the shoulder joint. The diagnosis of a RCT is largely based on patient’s symptoms, and accurate diagnosis is carried out using medical images; MRI data are currently widely used to diagnose RCTs. Once the MRI data of a patient’s shoulder is obtained, a skilled clinician identifies the site of rupture from several slice images and determines the presence, absence, and size of the rupture as well as the necessity of operation. While there is still controversy, automated deep-learning-based diagnosis is accepted for enhancing clinicians’ diagnostic performance in terms of accuracy and speed. Our proposed method utilizes the 3D information of a complete shoulder MRI volume, and performs the entire RCT diagnosis instantaneously. Unlike most existing previous CNN-based diagnosis methods, our method does not require intensive preprocessing of training data. Only the patient’s diagnosis information (normal or RCT size) and simple region of interest (ROI) selection are needed for preprocessing. Because the size of the RCT is measured during arthroscopic surgery, labeling results were credible in our retrospective study training data. Furthermore, our method uses fairly deep 3D CNN: three-dimensionally extended inception-ResNet. This network can extract meaningful 3D features from raw volume data for diagnosis by weakly-supervised learning. We also propose an effective visualization method using 3D volume rendering of class activation map (CAM)14. As a result, the proposed method automatically determines the RCT size in five categories (None, Partial, Small, Medium, Large-to-Massive) and visualizes the 3D localization information of RCT as a second opinion for clinical decision (Fig. 1).\n",
            "         230 Network structure of the proposed method for automated rotator cuff tear (RCT) diagnosis. Original shoulder MRI volume is cropped and sampled into 64 × 64 × 64 volume. The sampled volume is feed-forwarded to the VRN-based 3D CNN to classify the RCT case (None, Partial, Small, Medium, and Large-to-Massive).\n",
            "         242 For the multi-class RCT classification, the performance results for each group were summarized as a median with first & third quartiles) (Table 3). Also, the performance of the 3D CNN was compared with those of each human group using the statistical analysis of Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Bonferroni post hoc analysis with the significance level set at p < 0.0167. The VRN-based 3D CNN repeated the test 60 times for the same 200 test-set data, and the mean value of the 60 repetitions were used. As shown in Table 3a, the VRN-based CNN achieved top-1 accuracy of 69.0% and top 1 ± 1 accuracy of 87.5%; whereas the orthopedic shoulder specialists achieved top-1 accuracy of 45.8% and top 1±1 accuracy of 79.8%; and the general orthopedists had top-1 accuracy of 30.5% and top 1±1 accuracy of 71.0% as a median value. The VRN-based 3D CNN took only 0.01 s diagnostic time to classify one case. However, the orthopedic shoulder specialists and general orthopedists took 20.3 s and 34.2 s, respectively, to achieve the same tasks (Fig. 4b). According to the results of Bonferroni pot-hoc analysis for the performance for RCT classification between groups (Table 3b–f), statistically significant p-values were marked for Top-1 accuracy, Top-1 ± 1 accuracy, specificity, and diagnostic time.\n",
            "         245 We demonstrated the robustness of the proposed method in diagnosis of RCT MRI data by the evaluation test comparing with clinical experts. The experiment showed that the trained VRN-based 3D CNN outperforms human orthopedists in binary accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, f1-score, top-1 accuracy, top-1±1 accuracy, and diagnostic time. In comparative experiment results including clinical experts, the proposed method performed the best for all metrics. In binary accuracy results, it achieved 16.1% and 24.3% higher than orthopedists specialized in shoulder and general orthopedists. The results of sensitivity and specificity also proved the proposed method’s robustness. In the results of clinical experts, specificity tends to be low (0.58 for orthopedists specialized in shoulder; 0.29 for general orthopedists). The proposed method showed higher sensitivity (0.94) and specificity (0.90) than clinical experts. All the human expert results were under the VRN-based 3D CNN’s receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Fig. 3). In top-1 accuracy, the proposed method resulted in 23.2%, 38.5% higher than clinical experts. In top-1 ± 1 accuracy, the proposed method showed 7.7% and 16.5% higher than orthopedists specialized in shoulder and general orthopedists. The results were more dramatic when comparing the diagnostic time. Even we provided the participating clinical experts with specially-designed convenient in-house software for the evaluation test, it took more than 20 seconds per one case. In contrary, it took less than two seconds to diagnose 200 test data (0.01 s per one case in average) by the proposed method. These results indicates that the proposed method can reduce diagnostic time while supporting the accurate diagnosis of RCT.\n",

            "7 Dissociated leg muscle atrophy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease: the ‘split-leg’ sign\n",
            "         259 Disproportionate muscle atrophy is a distinct phenomenon in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); however, preferentially affected leg muscles remain unknown. We aimed to identify this split-leg phenomenon in ALS and determine its pathophysiology. Patients with ALS (n = 143), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA, n = 36), and age-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 53) were retrospectively identified from our motor neuron disease registry. We analyzed their disease duration, onset region, ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised Scores, and results of neurological examination. Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) of the extensor digitorum brevis (EDB), abductor hallucis (AH), and tibialis anterior (TA) were reviewed. Defined by CMAPEDB/CMAPAH (SIEDB) and CMAPTA/CMAPAH (SITA), respectively, the values of split-leg indices (SI) were compared between these groups. SIEDB was significantly reduced in ALS (p < 0.0001) and PMA (p < 0.0001) compared to the healthy controls (HCs). SITA reduction was more prominent in PMA (p < 0.05 vs. ALS, p < 0.01 vs. HC), but was not significant in ALS compared to the HCs. SI was found to be significantly decreased with clinical lower motor neuron signs (SIEDB), while was rather increased with clinical upper motor neuron signs (SITA). Compared to the AH, TA and EDB are more severely affected in ALS and PMA patients. Our findings help to elucidate the pathophysiology of split-leg phenomenon.\n",
            "         262 Recently, the “split-leg” sign in ALS was introduced as preferential wasting of gastrocnemius (ankle plantar flexor) compared to tibialis anterior (TA; ankle dorsiflexor)17. However, this contrasts to clinical experience in which ALS patients sometimes present with foot drop18. Of relevance, two successive studies that compared extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) and abductor hallucis (AH) muscles proposed larger degree of atrophy in the former19,20. Nonetheless, these studies did not compare the leg and foot muscles simultaneously nor investigate other forms of motor neuron disease such as progressive muscular atrophy and flail leg syndrome. Moreover, only one study included an ALS mimic (lumbar spondylosis) in its analysis, whereas the others compared ALS patients to healthy controls20. In the present study, we compared compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) of EDB, AH, and TA in ALS, progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), which is characterized solely by signs of LMN degeneration, and age-matched healthy controls (HC). If selective atrophy is present in ALS, we questioned whether it is also present in PMA. Further, through correlating clinical variables with the split-leg index (SI), we tried to gain insight into the underlying pathophysiology.\n",
            "         270 To investigate whether clinical variables affected dissociated leg muscle atrophy, we compared the SI of motor neuron disease (MND; ALS or PMA) legs according to the clinical UMN or LMN signs in the lumbosacral segment (Fig. 2). Both SIEDB and SITA were modestly lower in legs with positive LMN signs, but statistical significance (p < 0.05) was only met in the comparison of SIEDB. SITA was significantly increased in legs with positive UMN signs (p < 0.01). When we correlated SI with the site of disease onset, both SIs were significantly lower in lower-limb-onset MND compared to bulbar or upper-limb-onset MND (SIEDB: bulbar-onset 0.22 [0.17–0.31], upper-limb-onset 0.21 [0.14–0.36], lower-limb-onset 0.13 [0.02–0.30]. SITA: bulbar-onset 0.50 [0.38–0.67], upper-limb-onset 0.50 [0.34–0.73], lower-limb-onset 0.34 [0.16–0.59], p < 0.05 for lower-limb-onset versus bulbar or upper-limb-onset groups, both SIEDB and SITA) (Fig. 3).\n",
            "         277 Of note, cortical influences do not fully explain our findings. Patients with PMA, who did not show any clinical UMN signs, revealed prominent split-leg signs. Moreover, SIEDB in MND patients with clinical LMN signs was significantly lower than that in those without. Accordingly, we propose additional peripheral pathophysiological mechanisms to support these results. In ALS, it is known that lower motor neurons innervating fast-twitching myofibers, with larger soma and higher innervation ratios, are especially prone to degeneration27. Hence, heterogeneous anterior horn cell-composition within lower limbs might attribute to the uneven atrophy. In addition, repeated phasic activation of dorsiflexors during locomotion might produce greater oxidative stress in these antigravity muscles, leading to premature dieback28,29.\n",

            "         297 A consequence of a complete spinal cord injury (SCI) is the loss of gait capacity. Wearable exoskeletons for the lower extremity enable household and community ambulation in people with SCI. This study assessed the amount, purpose, and location of exoskeleton use in the home and community environment, without any restrictions. The number of steps taken was read from the exoskeleton software. Participants kept a daily logbook, and completed two user experience questionnaires (Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology (D-QUEST) and System Usability Scale (SUS)). Fourteen people with a complete SCI used the ReWalk exoskeleton a median of 9 (range [1–15]) out of 16 ([12–21]) days, in which participants took a median of 3,226 ([330–28,882]) steps. The exoskeleton was mostly used for exercise purposes (74%) and social interaction (20%). The main location of use was outdoors (48%). Overall, participants were satisfied with the exoskeleton (D-QUEST 3.7 ± 0.4) and its usability (SUS 72.5 [52.5–95.0]). Participants with complete SCI report satisfaction with the exoskeleton for exercise and social interaction in the home and community, but report limitations as an assistive device during daily life.\n",
            "         298 The incidence of spinal cord injury (SCI) is approximately 180,000 cases per year worldwide1. Half of the people with SCI have a complete lesion2, which has a huge impact on their daily lives3. For mobility, a manual wheelchair is the most common option. Over the last decade, an alternative locomotion option for people with SCI was introduced: a wearable exoskeleton. With an external active orthosis and supported by two crutches, the basic motions for ambulation (i.e., standing-up, sitting-down, standing, and walking) can be initiated and controlled.\n",
            "         300 In patients without (the potential for) ambulatory capacity (i.e., complete SCI), who are wheelchair users for their mobility, an exoskeleton can be used as an assistive device in order to walk. However, exoskeleton use as an assistive device without physical assistance from a trainer requires an intensive training period7,8,9. In our previous study, we have shown that more than half of the participants with a complete SCI could use an exoskeleton independent of assistance under supervision of a buddy after 24 training sessions9. Moreover, most of these participants were able to perform multiple advanced skills during independent walking (e.g. walking up and over a sloping doorstep) and standing (e.g. moving a cone at chest height)9,10, which strengthens the idea of exoskeleton home use during some daily activities. Another advantage of exoskeleton use are the potential health benefits11,12. Because of the possibility to stand and walk in an upright position, exoskeletons may help to prevent secondary health complications, such as spasticity11,12, impaired bowel function13, and related loss of quality of life11. From this perspective, exoskeletons are used as an exercise device to promote physical health and well-being by reducing secondary health complications. However, to actually reduce secondary health complications, the frequency and intensity of exoskeleton use are critical. The intensity of walking with an exoskeleton is similar to regular physical activities performed at a moderate intensity14,15, which is known to yield health benefits12. In contrast to the use of conventional knee–ankle–foot–orthoses, the use of exoskeletons is not physically exhausting16,17, which is why they can be used more regularly14. This strengthens the idea of continued exoskeleton use at home and/or in the community18.\n",
            "         301 To date, one study described a gym-based setting for exoskeleton use19. To our knowledge, no other studies have been described for the use of exoskeletons outside the clinical setting. Instead of in the actual home and community environment, exoskeleton use was investigated in a gym-based setting. Four participants with SCI were interviewed and reported that gym-based exoskeleton use had a positive impact on their lives and enhanced their perceived wellbeing and sense of community integration19. Yet, daily life entails much more than just the usage in a gym-based setting. According to Fritz et al.20, home and community use entails engaging in age normative and meaningful activities such as meeting friends at a pub, attending a graduation ceremony, performing one’s job, or going on holiday20. In addition to these social activities, home and community use also entails household chores such as cooking or doing the laundry. The question thus remains whether exoskeletons are already applicable in these settings21. Up to now, the applicability and effectiveness of exoskeletons in the community have not been demonstrated. Some expected challenges for community exoskeleton use are the limited gait speed, the heavy weight during transport, and the need of a buddy18,22. Only when users had an exoskeleton at their disposal in the community, the full range of problematic scenarios and safety concerns become apparent20. Such information is an important step for further exoskeleton development. Hence, the main objective of the present study was to assess the amount, purpose, and location of exoskeleton use in the home and community environment by people with complete SCI. Users’ experiences and health related effects during this period were studied as well.\n",
            "         303 People with complete SCI who gained knowledge about the existence and availability of an exoskeleton through the media and who were interested in testing the potential of such an exoskeleton contacted the rehabilitation center of the Sint Maartenskliniek to participate in this study. The eligibility criteria have been described previously10. Adults in the chronic phase (> 6 months) after a motor complete SCI (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) A or B) between the levels Thoracic 1 (Th1) and Lumbar 1 (L1) were eligible. Persons with physical characteristics that would hamper proper functioning of the exoskeleton, such as severe spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale > 3), body height more than 1.90 m or less than 1.60 m, body weight above 100 kg, or restricted range of motion at any hip, knee or ankle joint were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were inability to control crutches, inability to make a transfer from a regular chair to a wheelchair without the use of external support, and any co-morbidity or condition that could interfere with motor learning (e.g. stroke). Subjects with an increased risk of adverse events, such as those with osteoporosis, fractures of the lower extremities during the previous 2 years, balance disorders, neurogenic heterotopic ossification, or pregnancy, were also excluded. The increased risk of adverse events was checked by the rehabilitation physician through questions. From participant 7 onwards, osteoporosis was tested with a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)-scan at the hip. Before participants were allowed to use the exoskeleton at home or in the community, the following criteria had to be met:\n",
            "         307 The ReWalk Personal 6.0, a wearable robotic exoskeleton from ReWalk Robotics that enables powered hip and knee motion, was used. The exoskeleton provided user-initiated mobility through the integration of a wearable brace support, a computer-based control system, and motion sensors. The ReWalk Personal 6.0 has a Class II FDA clearance for use both in a clinical setting and in the home and community environment24.\n",
            "         309 Participants had no restrictions regarding the amount, purpose, or at which location they used the exoskeleton. For safety reasons, they were instructed not to use the exoskeleton without supervision of their buddy. The period of home and community use was at least two weeks with a maximum of three weeks per participant. The return date was agreed in advance, depending on the schedules of both the participant and the physical therapist. Before and after a period of home and community use, the number of steps taken was read from the exoskeleton software and notated. During the period of home and community use, participants filled in a logbook each day. If participants did not use the exoskeleton on a specific day, a short reason was given, while the other sections of the logbook were left blank. If participants did use the exoskeleton, the complete logbook was filled in (see Fig. 1). The logbook included questions regarding the performed activities with the exoskeleton, the amount of use, and skin integrity. Comments related to the overall experience with the exoskeleton and/or health related effects could be registered in the blank sections of the logbook. After the first week, the primary researcher (RD) called the participants by phone to check whether the logbook was filled in correctly and to monitor if they had experienced any problems. When the exoskeleton was returned to the clinic, the logbook was handed in and two user experience questionnaires were completed by the participants: (1) the Dutch version of the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology scale (D-QUEST 1–5 scale)25 and (2) the System Usability Scale (SUS 0–100 scale)26.\n",

            "         313 Exoskeleton home and community use was assessed as (1) the amount of use, (2) the purpose of use, and (3) the location of use. The primary outcomes for exoskeleton use were the total number of steps taken, total number of days of usage, and total number of sessions. The total number of steps was extracted from the exoskeleton software (i.e. difference in total number of steps between the start and the end of the period of home and community use). The total days of usage and total number of sessions were obtained from the logbook (i.e. a completed page in the logbook indicated that they used the exoskeleton that day and multiple sessions on a day were written down). In addition, the amount of use per day (i.e. minutes of active time, total distance covered, and maximal distance covered without rest) was estimated by the participants and extracted from the logbook. Per session, the purpose and location of use were derived from the logbook and divided into various categories for the analysis. The five categories for purpose of use were: (1) individual exercise, (2) participation/social event, (3) exercise and social event, (4) explore indoor usability, and (5) other. The definitions of these purpose categories are described in Table 1. Location of use was divided into four categories: (1) outdoor use, (2) in home use, (3) indoor use at location (e.g. local fitness hall or indoor parking lot) and (4) mixture of use at the same day (i.e. indoor/home and outdoor). The percentage per category was calculated as the number of session per category divided by the total number of sessions. Reasons for non-use were extracted from the logbook.\n",
            "         316 The exoskeleton experience was assessed as the satisfaction, importance, and usability of different aspects of the exoskeleton. In addition, other experiences with the exoskeleton (e.g. fall or device error) that were recorded in the logbook were evaluated. Satisfaction was derived from the 12-item D-QUEST questionnaire25 and divided into satisfaction with the assistive device (8 items), satisfaction with the service (4 items), and overall satisfaction (average). The satisfaction (sub)scores ranged between 1 and 5, with a higher score indicating greater satisfaction. Item analysis of satisfaction scores was performed, in which an item score of 1, 2 or 3 was considered dissatisfied27. In addition, the importance of each item was analysed by calculating how frequent a particular item was indicated by the participants as one of the three most important items. Usability was derived from the 10-item SUS questionnaire26 and evaluated as the overall usability and at item level. Each SUS item was scored from 0 (low usability) to 4 (high usability). The overall SUS score was calculated by multiplying the sum of the item scores by 2.5 and ranged between 0 and 10026, with a higher score indicating better usability. A mean SUS item score below 3 was considered low usability.\n",
            "         322 Fourteen participants had the exoskeleton at their disposal for home and community use. An overview of the participant characteristics is given in Table 2. Median exoskeleton use was 9 (range 1–15) out of 16 (range 12–21) days, in which participants performed a median of 9.5 (range 1–19) sessions and took a median of 3,226 (range 330–28,882) steps. An overview of the amount of exoskeleton use per participant is given in Table 3. Per day, the estimated median active time was 46 (range 19–84) minutes, during which the median estimated total distance covered was 243 (range 22–1,367) meters and the median estimated maximal distance covered without rest was 120 (range 12–1,125) meters (Table 3). The subject-reported primary purpose of exoskeleton use was for individual exercise (90 out of 121 sessions, 74% of all sessions) (Fig. 2). Other purposes of exoskeleton use were a combination of exercise and social event (14%, 17 sessions), participation/social event (6%, 7 sessions), explore indoor usability (4%, 5 sessions), or other (2%, 2 sessions). The location of exoskeleton use was mostly outdoors (58 out of 121 sessions, 48% of all sessions) (Fig. 3). The remaining location of exoskeleton use was 27% (33 sessions) indoors (e.g. gym or indoor parking lot), 19% (23 sessions) combination of indoors and outdoors, and 6% (7 sessions) at home. The following factors were mentioned as reasons for non-use of the exoskeleton: weather conditions (i.e. storm (participant I) and snowstorm (participant M)), becoming a father (participant J), dependence on buddy availability (participant K), and not meeting expectations (participant L).\n",
            "         326 Location of exoskeleton use during the period of home and community use.\n",
            "         330 This study assessed the amount, purpose, and location of exoskeleton use in the home and community environment in people in the chronic phase of motor complete SCI. In addition, users’ experiences and health related effects during the home and community use were studied. Fourteen people with a complete SCI used the exoskeleton 9 out of 16 days. The exoskeleton was mostly used for exercise purposes and social interaction. In half of the sessions the location of use was outdoors. Overall, participants were satisfied with the exoskeleton and its usability.\n",
            "         332 Based on the purpose and location of use, the potential of a wearable exoskeleton can be identified. The expected potential of an exoskeleton has previously been addressed in a qualitative study by Manns and colleagues28. They found that some participants expected the best potential for outdoor exoskeleton ambulation, whereas others expected better potential for functional indoor use during daily life activities (e.g. cooking while standing)28. Yet, only when participants have an exoskeleton at their disposal in the home and community setting, the full potential of an exoskeleton can be truly assessed. In the current study, all participants used the exoskeleton for exercise purposes and two thirds of the participants used it for social interaction, either with or without exercise. For exercise and social interaction purposes, the exoskeleton was used at locations with large, open, and smooth surfaces, either outdoors or indoors. In contrast, the exoskeleton was barely used at home. Indoor usability at home was explored by only four participants (and repeated once by merely one participant). The current findings support the general thought that an exoskeleton has a high potential to be used as an exercise device and for social interaction at eye-level, but a low potential as an assistive device for supporting daily activities18,20.\n",
            "         333 Despite the shortcomings of the investigated exoskeleton as an assistive device during daily life activities, participants were generally satisfied with its use. Based on conversations with the participants, we assume that participants evaluated their overall satisfaction of the exoskeleton with respect to the current use and their expected applications. Most participants used it as an exercise device and for social interactions and indicated the following aspects of improvement in order of importance: ease of use, effectiveness, safety, and weight. Ease of use has also been rated as most important for manual wheelchair29,30 and walker use29. One difference between wheelchair / walker use and exoskeleton use is, the requirement of a buddy during exoskeleton use, thus potentially limiting the individual’s independence. Ten of the participants reported that the buddy was a hindrance, as has been reported in other studies18,22. The buddy requirement presumably influenced the other three aspects of improvement (effectiveness, safety, and weight) as well. The comments related to ‘satisfaction with effectiveness’ (e.g. the degree to which the device meets one’s needs) reflected participants’ desire for independent functional use. The participants also commented that they felt most safe with the buddy constantly guarding them during use and that because of the weight (~ 27 kg) of the device, a buddy was needed for transporting the device in and out of their cars. Since detailed information regarding transportation was not investigated in the current study, future studies should investigate the implications and issues regarding transport. Nevertheless, participants also emphasized that there are no other devices that enable similar options for exercise or social interaction in an upright position. Therefore, the overall satisfaction with the exoskeleton and its usability was considered as good, although less need for a buddy and improved transportability is desired. For these reasons, it is important to investigate how the exoskeleton can be further improved with respect to the applications that users have in mind.\n",
            "         335 In the current study, participants with a low (Th7–12, n = 8) and high (Th1–6, n = 6) complete SCI who could control crutches were included, reflecting a large range of the complete SCI population. However, selection bias is likely, because only people with a complete SCI who were interested in exoskeleton use and who could commit to the exoskeleton training protocol participated. Furthermore, only participants who achieved a skill level for safe home and community use (i.e. at least 17 final skills in the previously described Final-skills-test10) were included. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution and are not generalizable to the whole SCI population.\n",
            "         336 In conclusion, the exoskeleton investigated in this study (ReWalk) has a good potential to be used as an exercise device in the home and community environment. For this purpose, participants with a motor complete SCI were satisfied with its use, but wished for technological improvements to reduce the need for a buddy and to improve the overall transportability of the device. In addition, the exoskeleton enables social interaction at eye-level. Therefore, the use of an exoskeleton has the potential to contribute to the physical and mental health in people with complete SCI. As an assistive device during daily life activities, the exoskeleton has many limitations. Further exoskeleton development should, thus, look at other (more functional) applications that are important to their potential users.\n",

            "         338 Body postures are essential in animal behavioural repertoires and their communicative role has been assessed in a wide array of taxa and contexts. Some body postures function as amplifiers, a class of signals that increase the detection likelihood of other signals. While foraging on the ground, bonobos (Pan paniscus) can adopt different crouching postures exposing more or less of their genital area. To our knowledge, their potential functional role in the sociosexual life of bonobos has not been assessed yet. Here we show, by analysing more than 2,400 foraging events in 21 captive bonobos, that mature females adopt a rear-exposing posture (forelimb-crouch) and do so significantly more often when their anogenital region is swollen than during the non-swollen phase. In contrast, mature males almost completely avoid this posture. Moreover, this strong difference results from a diverging ontogeny between males and females since immature males and females adopt the forelimb-crouch at similar frequencies. Our findings suggest that the forelimb-crouch posture may play a communicative role of amplification by enhancing the visibility of female sexual swellings, a conspicuous signal that is very attractive for both males and females. Given the high social relevance of this sexual signal, our study emphasizes that postural signalling in primates probably deserves more attention, even outside of reproductive contexts.\n",
            "         340 While postures have long been mentioned as important in great ape communication, they have been overlooked in the recent surge of great ape gesture research6 and, to our knowledge, no study has ever considered their potential role as amplifier signals. Here, we aim to fill this gap by examining the role of two foraging postures in bonobos (Pan paniscus).\n",
            "         342 While foraging on the ground, bonobos routinely pick up food directly with the mouth adopting two different postures: full-crouch, in which elbows and hindlimbs are flexed, and forelimb-crouch, in which the elbows are flexed but the knees are not (14 and Fig. 1). In contrast with the full-crouch posture, the forelimb-crouch posture has the peculiarity of exposing the anogenital area, but this postural behaviour has never been investigated as a potential communicative signal. Both postures typically coexist in each individual’s repertoire and, to the best of our knowledge, it is still unknown whether social or ecological factors influence these postural behaviours. In this observational study focussing on the emitter’s perspective, we provide a thorough analysis of the occurrence of forelimb-crouch and full-crouch in bonobos by putting these two body postures in relation with individual features, such as age, gender, and reproductive and hierarchical status. Knowing the importance of socio-sexual behaviours in bonobo society, our hypothesis is that the foraging posture, by enhancing the visibility of the anogenital swelling, could play a communicative role in the social and reproductive preferences of bonobos and match the definition of amplifier3,4, which is still sparsely documented in the animal kingdom. We thus predict that the rear-exposing forelimb-crouch posture is not equally adopted among individuals. More specifically, we predict that adult females adopt this posture more frequently than adult males and immature subjects, and that this posture is preferred when the sexual swelling is in the maximum phase.\n",
            "         357 Our results show that whereas immature bonobos did not show any significant sex differences in positional preference, mature bonobos displayed strong preferences either to adopting the rear-exposing forelimb-crouch (females) or to avoiding it (males). For mature females, the changes in their postural behaviours through their sexual swelling cycle suggest a stronger preference for forelimb-crouching during the swelling phases (i.e., intermediate and maximum) over the non-swelling phase. In all cases, individuals engaging in foraging events longer than 12 s tended to adopt the full-crouch posture, which is compatible with the physiological cost of ingesting food with an upside-down digestive tract. These findings outline a general pattern with a random distribution between forelimb-crouching and full-crouching for immature subjects and for mature females in the minimal swelling phase. In contrast, the dichotomy observed between mature females in swollen phases and mature males strongly suggests a non-random sex-dependent cost–benefit ratio. The infrequency of forelimb-crouch in mature males may be driven by the need to reduce the risk of exposing the testicles, a body part often targeted during conflicts in the Pan species19,20. For mature females, the fact that dominance rank did not influence the probability of forelimb-crouch lets us reject the competing explanation that this posture might represent a hierarchy signal21. Moreover, the fact that a general preference for full-crouching for longer foraging events was also observed in females during the maximum swelling phase rules out the competing explanation that this posture is adopted because the swelling hinders full-crouching.\n",
            "         358 Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that the forelimb-crouch posture represents a low-cost means of improving the signalling efficiency of sexual swelling in bonobos. As mentioned above, bonobo maximum swelling has an extremely prolonged duration and is not a reliable indicator of ovulation, resulting in a decreased reliability of bonobo maximum swelling as a fecundity signal, which, in turn, influences male mating strategies by increasing the costs of mate-guarding to ascertain paternity9. It is acknowledged that the features of female swelling contribute to shaping bonobo peaceful society by decreasing the level of male competition22. Moreover, this swelling signal is also sexually attractive for females, and it has been proposed that its prolonged duration was selected to increase female cohesiveness11. Bonobo females are indeed unique among primates for the extensive use of same-sex sexual behaviour. Sexual interactions in female dyads (but not in mixed-sex dyads) increase their urinary level of oxytocin, a hormone promoting social bonding and cooperation12 and allow them to limit male harassment and to reach high hierarchical positions in a male philopatric society23. Therefore, broadcasting their sexual swelling signal to the highest number of potential receivers, both males and females, appears essential for bonobo females. In this sense, the forelimb-crouch posture may be interpreted as an amplifier signal of sexual swelling, the combination of posture and sexual swelling resulting in a unimodal (visual) composite signal24. Although several physical or behavioural amplifiers have been shown to enhance visual salience, and the Amplifier Hypothesis proposed by Oren Hasson in 19893 has been advocated in theoretical and computational models25,26,27, empirical studies are still rare, limited to a few taxa and to the context of courtship and reproduction28,29,30. Therefore, the Amplifier Hypothesis is still debated27, but models predict that any cost-limited amplifier that enhances the perception of a relevant signal should be under positive selection. This strongly suggests that the existence of amplifiers may have been overlooked in natural behaviours and that we also need to provide empirical case studies covering a wider array of behavioural contexts and species, in parallel with clearer theoretical and terminological positions.\n",
            "         359 The diverging ontogeny of forelimb-crouching between males and females revealed in our study supports the hypothesis that the forelimb-crouch posture has been selected in female emitters for its functional role in the regulation of bonobo society. In particular, the decrease in the frequency of forelimb-crouch in adult males is highly compatible with the need of protecting their genitals from possible attacks19,20. In contrast, adult females increase their tendency to adopt this posture and our data support the view that they do so to increase the visibility of their swollen anogenital region. The interpretation of the forelimb-crouch posture as a visual amplifier of sexual swelling in bonobos would broaden the current empirical evidence on amplifiers, by providing three novel characteristics: it amplifies a female sexual signal outside the reproductive context by increasing its conspicuousness for a large audience. Moreover, this would be the first time a postural amplifier is discovered in primates.\n",
            "         360 By focussing on postural signal production, our study addresses an aspect that has been overlooked so far in primates. Our results encourage further studies evaluating potential audience effects, as well as male and female receivers’ attention and behavioural responses to confirm that this posture has a communicative function aimed at enhancing swelling visibility in bonobos. There is as yet no evidence that the forelimb-crouch is used as a sexual invitation and we do not believe that this posture is an overt sexual solicitation. It is primarily a foraging posture that highlights the genital parts and thus the sexual swelling stage of adult females. Because of the lack of data in situ, it is currently difficult to assess the efficiency of such visual amplification. Although bonobos live in forest habitats, these are of heterogeneous types. Whereas previous studies on wild bonobos have mainly been conducted in rich tropical rainforests, it has been recently confirmed that wild bonobos inhabit a wider range of environments than previously thought, and notably forest-savanna mosaic environments31,32,33,34, and the efficient range in the visual channel thus varies among these forest habitat types. In line with the importance of visual communication in bonobos (e.g. gestures35), a potential amplifier role of forelimb-crouching is thus possible and our unambiguous results in captivity are consistent with this hypothesis. However, we cannot exclude that captivity has favoured this behaviour since (i) the visibility between individuals is almost permanent and (ii) bonobos spend more time on the ground foraging than in the wild (F. Levréro’s personal communication). In addition, we suggest that the forelimb-crouch posture might be present in other primate species showing sexual swelling, where it might enhance this more reliable signal of fertility. More generally, by focussing on human’s closest living relatives our study bridges theoretical and empirical aspects and sheds light on postural signalling as a potential neglected dimension of the evolutionary pathways leading to improved communication efficiency in animals, including humans.\n",

            "         362 In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the effects of antifibrotic agents on the prognosis remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of antifibrotic treatment on the risks of mortality, hospitalisation, and acute exacerbation in real-world patients with IPF. A total of 1213 IPF patients (biopsy-proven cases: 405) were included in this retrospective study. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics between patients who received antifibrotic treatment and who did not. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to compare the risks of all-cause mortality, hospitalisation, acute exacerbation, and mortality following acute exacerbation between the two groups. From the 1213 patients, 474 matched pairs were generated. The mean age of the patients in the matched cohort was 65.8 years and 82.8% were men. The median follow-up duration was 27 months. Antifibrotic treatment significantly reduced the risks of mortality [hazard ratio (HR), 0.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.48–0.72; p < 0.001], all-cause hospitalisation (HR 0.71), respiratory-related hospitalisation (HR 0.67), acute exacerbation (HR 0.69), and mortality after acute exacerbation (HR 0.60). Our results suggest that antifibrotic treatment may reduce the risks of all-cause mortality, hospitalisation, acute exacerbation, and mortality after acute exacerbation in patients with IPF.\n",

The risk of non-respiratory-related hospitalisation was lower in the antifibrotic group, although this difference was not statistically significant (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46–1.01; p = 0.055).\n",
            "         390 Impact of antifibrotic treatment in the study subjects that include sildenafil users\n",
            "         391 Additional analyses were performed in study subjects including those treated with sildenafil. Propensity score matching yielded 530 matched pairs and their baseline characteristics are described in Supplementary Table 3. Patients who received sildenafil comprised 11.1% and 11.5% of the antifibrotic and no-antifibrotic group, respectively. As compared with the main analysis, inclusion of patients treated with sildenafil did not change the trend of beneficial effects of antifibrotic treatment. All-cause mortality (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.52–0.75; p < 0.001), all-cause hospitalisation (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.64–0.95; p = 0.013), respiratory-related hospitalisation (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.61–0.95; p = 0.015), and mortality after acute exacerbation (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.49–0.91; p = 0.011) were significantly lower with antifibrotic treatment as shown in Supplementary Figure S1. The risk of acute exacerbation tended to be lower in patients with antifibrotic treatment than in those treated without antifibrotic agents although it was not statistically significant (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.58–1.04; p = 0.084).\n",
            "         392 Our study results suggest that antifibrotic treatment reduces the risks of all-cause mortality, hospitalisation (all-cause and respiratory-related), AE, and mortality after AE in the real-world cohort with IPF. The risk of all-cause mortality was approximately 40% lower in patients treated with antifibrotic agents than in those not administered antifibrotic agents.\n",
            "         393 The mortality benefit of antifibrotic agents is thought to persist during follow-up according to the results of our study and previous studies28,29. In open-label extension studies in which patients who finished the phase 3 trials were included to examine the long-term effect and safety profiles of antifibrotic medications, the effect of both pirfenidone and nintedanib on slowing the annual rate of FVC decline persisted beyond the clinical trial periods28,29. Therefore, it seems acceptable to assume that antifibrotic treatment also improves long-term clinical outcomes such as the risks of mortality and hospitalisation, as shown in our study. Interestingly, a recent study which analysed the clinical effectiveness of antifibrotic agents using an insurance database in the US found that the mortality benefit of antifibrotic treatment was observed only during the first 2 years of treatment30. The authors suggested some plausible reasons for this finding, one of which was that lung fibrosis continues despite antifibrotic treatment and vascular remodelling diminishes drug deposition in the lung parenchyma. It is unclear why a difference exists between the US data and our study, but the persistent mortality benefit shown in our study seems reasonable given the results of previous clinical trials and pooled analyses10, 12.\n",
            "         395 Aside from the incidence of AE, we found that the incidence of mortality following AE was also significantly lower in the antifibrotic group. To date, a few studies have suggested that antifibrotic treatment may reduce the risk of mortality after AE6,11,34,35. In a previous pooled analysis that showed that pirfenidone reduced the risk of unexpected hospitalisation, pirfenidone treatment was also found to significantly reduce the risk of mortality after hospitalisation (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32–0.99; p = 0.047)11. Given that AE is the most common cause of hospitalisation in IPF patients6, this finding may suggest that pirfenidone reduces the risk of mortality after AE, although this was not specifically investigated in that study. In a small study involving 20 IPF patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) due to severe AE, pirfenidone was associated with a survival benefit34; patients who were taking pirfenidone at the time of admission (n = 11) had a significantly longer median survival after AE (137 days vs. 16 days, p = 0.009) than the control group (n = 9) and tended to have a lower ICU mortality rate (27.3 vs. 77.8%, p = 0.070). With regards to nintedanib, in the post-hoc analysis of the INPULSIS trials (n = 69), the 30-, 90-, and 180-day mortality rates after AE were numerically lower in patients treated with nintedanib than in those who received placebo (30-day: 20.6% vs. 40.0%; 90-day: 29.4% vs. 42.9%; 180-day: 35.3% vs. 57.1%)35. Along with the results of our study, these findings suggest that antifibrotic treatment reduces the risk of not only AE but also mortality after AE. Further studies are required to confirm this promising effect of antifibrotic treatment.\n",

            "         398 An understanding of immunological mechanisms in kidney diseases has advanced using mouse kidneys. However, the profiling of immune cell subsets in human kidneys remains undetermined, particularly compared with mouse kidneys. Normal human kidneys were obtained from radically nephrectomised patients with urogenital malignancy (n = 15). Subsequently, human kidney immune cell subsets were analysed using multicolor flow cytometry and compared with subsets from C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice under specific pathogen-free conditions. Twenty kidney sections from healthy kidney donors or subjects without specific renal lesions were additionally analysed by immunohistochemistry. In human kidneys, 47% ± 12% (maximum 63%) of immune cells were CD3+ T cells. Kidney CD4+ and CD8+ T cells comprised 44% and 56% of total T cells. Of these, 47% ± 15% of T cells displayed an effector memory phenotype (CCR7− CD45RA− CD69−), and 48% ± 19% were kidney-resident cells (CCR7− CD45RA− CD69+). However, the proportions of human CD14+ and CD16+ myeloid cells were approximately 10% of total immune cells. A predominance of CD3+ T cells and a low proportion of CD14+ or CD68+ myeloid cells were also identified in healthy human kidney sections. In mouse kidneys, kidney-resident macrophages (CD11blow F4/80high) were the most predominant subset (up to 50%) but the proportion of CD3+ T cells was less than 20%. These results will be of use in studies in which mouse results are translated into human cases under homeostatic conditions or with disease.\n",

The proportion of the CD14+ monocyte/macrophage subset was 10.2% ± 4.7%. Most CD14+ monocyte and macrophage subsets in the kidney did not express CD16, and thus, these were categorized by the expression levels of CD64 and HLA-DR19. Among CD14+ cells, CD64+ HLA-DR+ (35.1% [3.6% of CD45+ cells]) and CD64+ HLA-DR− cells (53.6% [5.4% of CD45+ cells]) were the main subsets, and CD64− HLA-DR− cells were the minor subset (11.3% [1.2% of CD45+ cells]) (Fig. 2b). There were almost no CD64− HLA-DR+ cells among CD14+ cells. The proportions of cDCs and neutrophils were 1.1% ± 0.6% and 11.5% ± 5.8%, respectively. Collectively, the most abundant immune cell subset in human kidneys was CD3+ T cells. This trend did not differ between male and female subjects or was not dependent on kidney dysfunction (see Supplementary Fig. S1).\n",

CD3+, CD68+, and CD14+ cells in the interstitial area were counted after excluding cells within vessels, tubules, and glomeruli. Figure 3a is a representative image of sections from healthy donors. Compared with frequently observed CD3+ cells, CD68+ or CD14+ cells were rarely seen. When stained cells were counted, the number of CD3+ cells was higher than those of CD68+ and CD14+ cells (Fig. 3c). This trend remained consistent in subjects without specific renal lesions (Fig. 3b,d). These results supported the flow cytometric results where CD3+ T cells were dominant in human kidneys compared with CD14+ monocytes and macrophages. When these interstitial immune cells were stained in normal kidney tissues from nephrectomised patients, the residency of CD3+ T cells was higher than that of CD68+ or CD14+ cells (see Supplementary Fig. S2).\n",

The present study investigated whether human kidneys harboured different immune cell subsets from mouse kidneys. Of note, the ratio of CD3+ T cells to monocytes/macrophages was higher in human kidneys than in mouse kidneys.\n",
            "         420 Kidneys have a distinct immune system, and thus, subsets of resident immune cells are different from those in other organs22,23. Kidneys contain specialized rMac that monitor and scavenge the endothelial transport of immune complexes, and subsequently trigger type III hypersensitivity responses20. These phenomena may be crucial in diseases attributable to the insufficient clearance of immune complexes24. The proangiogenic activity of kidney-resident macrophages during renal artery stenosis was also reported25. This frontline and potential homeostatic activity of rMac may be related to their high proportion in mouse kidneys. However, the residency and proportion of rMac have not been fully evaluated in human kidneys. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing data suggested that markers such as CD74 and CD81 might characterize human kidney-rMac26. However, these markers are also expressed on other myeloid subsets of that dataset or on non-myeloid cells27. Accordingly, the present study used conventional myeloid markers such as CD14, CD64, HLA-DR, and CD68 to identify macrophages and monocytes, not rMac alone. Nevertheless, fewer numbers of macrophages and/or monocytes were present in human kidneys compared with mouse kidneys, and this might result in a high frequency of other immune subsets such as T cells in human kidneys.\n",

            "         438 The incidence of anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy remains around 10%. It was previously reported that PDSII rapidly loses tensile strength at pH 1.0 and pH 8.5. By contrast, LACLON degradation is reportedly insensitive to pH. We therefore compared LACLON with PDSII for esophago-gastric conduit, layer-to-layer, handsewn anastomosis. Between January 2016 and January 2020, 90 patients who received posterior mediastinal gastric conduit reconstruction with layer-to-layer handsewn anastomosis (51 using PDSII and 39 using LACLON) at Akita University Hospital were enrolled. The incidence of anastomotic leakage was significantly lower in the LACLON (2.6%, 1/39 patients) than PDSII group (15.7%, 8/51 patients) (p = 0.0268). Multivariable logistic analysis showed the risk of anastomotic leakage was significantly greater with PDSII than LACLON (odds ratio 11.01; 95% CI 1.326–277.64; p = 0.024). The percentages of time the pH was higher than 8 on the gastric conduit side of the anastomosis were 3.1%, 5.7%, 20.9% and 80.5%, respectively, in the four most recent patients. The present study showed that pH at the anastomosis soon after esophagectomy tends to be alkaline rather than acidic, which raises the possibility that this alkalinity facilitates the deterioration of surgical sutures including PDSII.\n",
            "         440 Absorbable monofilament sutures are widely used for handsewn anastomosis of the mucosal layer of the digestive tract. Among those, PDSII (p-dioxanone, ETHICON, New Brunswick, NJ) reportedly loses about 40% of its tensile strength within 1 week at pH 1.0 and 100% of its tensile strength within 2 weeks. In addition, PDSII loses about 25% of its tensile strength after 2 weeks at pH 8.5. This suggests that care must be taken when PDSII is used to close tissues in contact with acidic or alkaline media4. By contrast, LACLON (L-lactide:ε + caprolactone, CROWNJUN, Chiba, Japan) retains 100% of its tensile strength after 2 weeks at pH 1.0 or pH 8.5. In the present study, therefore, we compared the incidences of anastomotic leakage when PDSII or LACLON was used for esophago-gastric conduit layer-to-layer handsewn anastomosis after esophagectomy.\n",

The results of univariable analysis are summarized in Table 2. Surgical suture (PDSII vs. LACLON), sex (female vs. male), neoadjuvant therapy (with vs. without), pN (0 vs 1–3), and pStage (0-IIA vs. IIb-IIIC) were all significant factors affecting the incidence of anastomotic leakage. Moreover, a multivariable logistic analysis taking into consideration sex, age at surgery, neoadjuvant therapy, pT, pN, pStage, and surgical suture showed that the risk of anastomotic leakage was significantly greater in the PDSII than the LACLON group (odds ratio 11.01; 95% CI 1.326–277.64; p = 0.024) (Table 3).\n",

For this purpose, we evaluated the protein levels of total CRMP2 and p-CRMP2 in the retinas after ONC with topical ripasudil or PBS treatment. We found that ripasudil significantly suppressed the ratio of p-CRMP2 to total CRMP2 compared with PBS at 3 h and 3 days, but not 7 days after ONC (Fig. 5a–f). We observed no marked changes in the protein levels of total CRMP2 in both groups. We also performed immunohistochemical analysis at 3 h after ONC and found that p-CRMP2 was observed in the inner retina in PBS-treated mice and double-labeled with RBPMS in the GCL (Fig. 5g). However, p-CRMP2 expression was suppressed in ripasudil-treated mice (Fig. 5g). Quantitative analyses confirmed that the phosphorylation of CRMP2 in the GCL is significantly suppressed with ripasudil treatment compared with PBS treatment (Fig. 5h). We also evaluated the protein levels of total cofilin and p-cofilin in the same retinas. We found that ripasudil significantly suppressed the ratio of p-cofilin compared with PBS at 3 h, 3 and 7 days after ONC (Fig. 6a–f). We observed no marked changes in the protein levels of total cofilin in both groups. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that p-cofilin was observed in the inner retina in PBS-treated mice, and its expression was suppressed in ripasudil-treated mice (Fig. 6g).

            "         488 The authors examine study participants who have Type 2 diabetes to determine whether cognition affects glucose levels in contrast to widely held suppositions. Thirty participants who have type 2 diabetes consume beverages that have identical ingredients but have deceptive nutrition facts labels. Blood glucose levels measured four times before and after beverage consumption show that blood glucose levels increase when participants believe the beverage has high sugar content as portrayed on the labels. Also, individual eating behaviors and nutritional satisfaction are linked to changes in blood glucose levels. The study results support the concept of anticipatory budgeting on glucose metabolism. The findings provide pressing evidence for the psychobiological model of chronic disease, suggesting that psychological intervention programs may be important for diabetes management, beyond current programs in which type 2 diabetes is managed through diet, exercise, and medications only.\n",
            "         493 In our recent work, participants with type 2 diabetes took part in a study that examined whether the perception of time passing affects blood glucose levels19. Participants fasted beforehand to ensure similar starting blood glucose levels and consumed no food or drink while playing simple video games, switching games every 15 min, and keeping track of time with clocks provided by the researchers. In all cases, the task period lasted 90 min, but some clocks were rigged to run fast or slow. Unadulterated clocks correctly indicated that 90 min had elapsed; fast clocks reported a total elapsed time of 180 min; slow clocks indicated that only 45 min had passed. All participants spent the same amount of time playing video games, but their time perceptions were altered. Blood glucose samples were drawn from each participant before and after the task period. Although all experienced the same elapsed time, the findings revealed that fasting blood glucose decreases have been associated with the perceived time passage rather than the actual time passage. In addition, participants who thought more time had passed reported being hungrier than those who thought less time had passed. These findings indicate that psychological processes can influence physiological levels, although the role of perceptional and cognitive processes in metabolism is still under-appreciated.\n",
            "         494 The biomedical model primarily assumes that blood glucose levels rise and fall as time passes after sugar intake. However, as discussed, the subjective perception rather than the objective passage of real time has been shown to determine blood glucose level changes in people with type 2 diabetes19. In the current study, we targeted the amount of sugar consumption, which is the most widely accepted factor in explaining blood glucose fluctuations, to investigate whether psychology mediates the effect on blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. We used a food label method similar to that used by Crum and colleagues5. Our study participants drank identical beverages containing the same amount of sugar level, but they were labeled as having either higher sugar or lower sugar. We hypothesized that perceived rather than actual sugar consumption would influence blood glucose levels. In addition, we aligned the study with empirical evidence regarding psychological factors that influence blood glucose levels such as perceived hunger19, stress and mood18, restrained eating behaviors20, and nutritional satisfaction21. We also searched for potential idiosyncratic factors that may influence blood glucose levels as well as potential mediators or moderators affecting the relation between perceived sugar consumption and blood glucose levels.\n",
            "         527 In this study, we tested whether psychological factors influence the effects of sugar consumption on blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that people with type 2 diabetes would show significant blood glucose responses to their perceptions of sugar consumption. Although beverages used in all study sessions contained the same sugar content, the results showed blood glucose profiles aligned more with what study participants had actually believed from the label of sugar contents (see Fig. 2). That is, blood glucose values changed according to the participants’ expectations (either low or high sugar content), and not to the amount of sugar they actually consumed.\n",
            "         529 It is, however, important to note that our study does not indicate whether psychological effects have long-term efficacy. Our findings instead suggest that psychological processes may be, at least temporarily, able to influence biochemical processes in diabetic metabolism. The excess of blood glucose occurring in hyperglycemia, together with the atypical performance of pancreas, however, fits well into the anticipatory budgeting mechanism. Emotions and mental states are linked to the autonomic nervous system, specifically the parasympathetic/sympathetic responses to blood glucose. Perceptions of sugar level would produce altered glucose dynamics as they provide a different signal to pancreas. A hyperglycemic response can be then understood as an excessive anticipatory energy budgeting following glucose perceptions. Additional research into the physiological or biochemical mechanisms underlying these psychological effects and their long-term effects is necessary to further refine the biopsychosocial model of diabetic metabolism.\n",
            "         535 Our study indicates that blood glucose level in people with type 2 diabetes is influenced by the perception of sugar consumption. Blood glucose levels increased in accordance with how much sugar participants believed they consumed rather than how much they actually consumed. These findings clearly show the inadequacy of the classical pathways to explain the metabolic and physiological reactions to food intake in diabetics suggested by the biomedical framework. Similarly, recent studies of chronic diseases, as well as on aging28,29, are consistently revealing the undeniable influence that psychological processes exert on various chronic physiological and biochemical conditions including diabetes19, cardiovascular disease30, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease31. In the face of rapidly surging epidemiological patterns of noninfectious fatal chronic diseases, we hope that our efforts to return the mind back to the equation of the dominant biomedical formulae will help stimulate more research endeavors in the biopsychosocial field. The goal is to find more effective treatments for millions who have resigned to feeling helpless in the battle against uncontrollable biological processes causing illness and disease, perhaps by recognizing that the mind has meaningful control in regulating health.\n",

            "         537 In the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, cerebellar Purkinje cells learn to respond to the conditional stimulus with an adaptively timed pause in its spontaneous firing. Evidence suggests that the pause is elicited by glutamate released from parallel fibers and acting on metabotropic receptors (mGluR7) which initiates a delayed-onset suppression of firing. We suggested that G protein activation of hyperpolarizing Kir3 channels (or ‘GIRK’, G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying K+ channels) could be part of such a mechanism. Application of the Kir3 antagonist Tertiapin-LQ locally in the superficial layers of the cerebellar cortex in decerebrate ferrets suppressed normal performance of Purkinje cell pause responses to the conditional stimulus. Importantly, there was no detectable effect on spontaneous firing. These findings suggest that intact functioning of Kir3 channels in the cerebellar cortex is required for normal conditioned Purkinje cell responses.\n",

            "         571 In conclusion, our data clearly show that application of the Kir3 antagonist TertiapinLQ near Purkinje cells disrupts conditional pause responses. While drug effects on other cell types cannot be excluded, our view is that the most plausible explanation of the results is that the integrity of Kir3 channels on the Purkinje cell is necessary for eliciting normal conditional Purkinje cell responses in classical conditioning. Importantly, this is not due to a simple increase in general excitability. The results suggest that Kir3 channels are legitimate candidates to explain at least part of the mechanism underlying Purkinje cell CRs. Given the prevalence of Kir3 channels throughout the brain, this may be a general mechanism of interest for a wide range of phenomena beyond classical conditioning.\n",

            "         581 Nickel oxide (NiO) films cover numerous electronic applications, including transparent conducting oxides and hole transport layer, because of its high transparency and wide band gap. A sparking discharge is a new and unique method for the deposition of NiO films due to non-complex operation and non-requirement of a vacuum atmosphere. Unfortunately, NiO films by the sparking method display a porous surface with inferior crystallinity. By assisting a uniform magnetic field in the sparking method, the porous and the crystallinity of NiO are improved. However, electrical properties of the NiO films deposited by this strategy are poor. In order to improve the electrical properties of NiO, a substitutional of Ni ions by Co ions is considered. In this study, we report an influence of Co concentration on properties of NiO films by sparking under a uniform magnetic field. Our results indicate that an increase in Co concentration to 0.1 M improves the crystallinity and increases a carrier concentration of NiO, resulting in a reduction of the resistivity. This consequence is in agreement with the increase in a number of higher-valence Ni3+ because of the Co2+ substituted Ni2+. Based on our research, Co-NiO film is promising materials for a transparent conductor.\n",
            "         584 Our work has focused on the influence of Co concentration on the properties of NiO films. The NiO films were deposited by sparking under the uniform magnetic field and its properties were modified by spin coating of Co solution at the different concentrations. The morphology, crystallinity and optical properties of Co-NiO films were characterized by an electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and UV–Vis spectrophotometer, respectively. Furthermore, the elemental compositions of films were also confirmed with an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. To investigate the electrical properties of Co-NiO films, Hall effect along with a van der Pauw method was used.\n",
            "         594 The transmission spectra of samples are displayed in Fig. 3a. The average transmittances (Tavg) of 0 M, 0.05 M, 0.1 M, 0.15 M and 0.2 M Co-NiO films are 93.32%, 73.54%, 58.73%, 47.81% and 41.34%, respectively. By using the ellipsometer, the thickness of 0 M, 0.05 M, 0.1 M, 0.15 M and 0.2 M Co-NiO films were measured to be 419 nm, 437 nm, 481 nm, 492 nm and 534 nm, respectively. As a result, the reduction of the Tavg is related to the increase in the thickness of films and the reflection of an incident light caused by submicron particles. Based on this result, films prepared by our method have a better Tavg than films prepared by a spray pyrolysis method due to an effect of crystallinity on transmittance21. The sparking under the uniform magnetic field can produce films with better crystallinity for the (200) plane, resulting in a higher Tavg compared with the spray pyrolysis method. However, the increase in the concentration of Co indicates that the Tavg of our films is lower than the films (Tavg = 85%) prepared by the spray pyrolysis method because of the effect of the submicron particles as mentioned above.\n",

            "         600 The chemical composition and the chemical bond of Co-NiO film were investigated by XPS. Note that the results of the investigation are displayed in Tables 1 and 2. Figure 4a illustrates the survey spectra of Co-NiO films, which reveals that the composition of the films is Ni, Co, O and C without other elementals. The appearance of carbon is caused by the contamination, which is commonly found in the air-exposed sample. As shown in Fig. 4b, the Co 2p core level spectrum contains the deconvoluted peaks of Co 1, Co 2, Co 3 and Co 4, which was assigned to Co2+ and Co3+22,23,24,25. The deconvolutions of the O 1s core level spectrum are shown in Fig. 4c. It was found that the peaks of O 1 and O 2 corresponded to O2−26,27. While the O 3 and O 4 peaks were in accordance with C(O)OH and O=C, respectively28. The C 1s core level spectrum displayed in Fig. 4d indicates five deconvoluted peaks of C 1, C 2, C 3, C 4 and C 5. These peaks were related to C–C, C–O, C=O, C=O and O=C–O, respectively29,30,31,32. To understand the influence of Co concentration on the quantity of Ni3+ and Ni2+, the Ni 2p core level spectrum of Co-NiO films was examined. As shown in Fig. 5a–e, it was found that the Ni 2p core level spectra of 0 M, 0.05 M, 0.1 M, 0.15 M and 0.2 M Co-NiO films consist of satellite and sublevel peaks of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2. These sublevel peaks were resolved into six peaks (Ni 1 to Ni 6), which Ni 1, Ni 2, Ni 4 and Ni 5 peaks were assigned to Ni2+ and the remaining peaks (Ni 3 and Ni 6) were registered to Ni3+33,34. The Ni 1 to Ni 6 peaks of 0 M, 0.05 M, 0.1 M, 0.15 M and 0.2 M Co-NiO films have a similar location but their intensity is different because the number of Ni3+ and Ni2+ ions in each condition is not equal, depending on Co concentration. With the increase in Co concentration, the Ni3+ ions in the NiO lattice increased as shown in Fig. 5f. The following decrease of the Ni3+ ions at the concentration of Co higher than 0.1 M was originated by the formation of CoO at the surface and grain boundaries of NiO, which act as carrier traps and prevent the substitution of Ni2+ ions by Co2+ ions. A similar explanation was found by other reports of doped-metal oxides35,36. Table 2 illustrates the chemical composition of Co-NiO films. It was found that the decrease in an atomic concentration (at%) of Ni 2p is affected by the increase in the content of Co, which is generally found in the report related to dopant37. To support the results of the chemical composition in Co-NiO films evaluated by XPS, the EDS was conducted. The results of the EDS demonstrate in Table 2. It has been observed that the values of Ni and Co measured by EDS are lower than the values from XPS. This is caused by receiving different information. For XPS, information on chemical composition comes from the surface of the film while EDS provides the information not only from the film but also from the glass substrate. Therefore, the quantity of Ni and Co elements are diminished by the chemical compositions of the glass substrate. Nevertheless, the percentage of change in at % of Ni and Co evaluated by EDS is similar to the result of XPS. Figure 6 presents the EDS mapping of Co-NiO films. For 0.05 M and 0.1 M, the Co, Ni and O elements are well distributed in the films while the distribution of Co at 0.15 M and 0.2 M is mostly found at the location of the submicron particles. This can be interpreted that the submicron particles are the CoO, which is in agreement with the result of XPS.\n",
            "         610 where R is the resistance, A is the area and L is the length between electrodes. As shown in Table 3, the decrease in resistivity from 9.9 × 10–3 to 7.89 × 10–3 Ω cm was caused by increasing the number of higher-valence Ni3+ due to the Co2+ substituted Ni2+38. According to this result, Co-NiO films fabricated by our method indicate the lower resistivity than Co-NiO films prepared by the solution methods22,39. It is well known that the resistivity is inversely related to the crystallite size40. Our method provides the film with two orders of magnitude bigger crystallite size than the films deposited by the solution method due to the influence of the uniform magnetic field on the sparking method as mentioned in our previous report19,39. At the higher concentration than 0.1 M, the resistivity of the films increased. This result is attributed to the increase of defects and the decrease of Ni3+, which is in agreement with the dislocation density and the carrier traps obtained by XRD and XPS. The electrical conductivity of Co-NiO film is shown in Fig. 7b. Obviously, the electrical conductivity of the films depends on the Co concentration, which is correlated with the resistivity in Table 3. To further investigate the electrical properties of Co-NiO film, Hall effect measured by the van der Pauw method was used. Note that the schematic diagram of the van der Pauw method is shown in Fig. 7c. The hall coefficient (RH) and the carrier concentration (n) of samples are given by the following equation41:\n",
            "         616 where VH is the change in voltage, d is the thickness of film, I is the constant current (50 mA), B is the magnetic field (100 mT) and e is the elementary charge (1.602 × 10–19 C). The results of the calculation are demonstrated in Table 3. It was observed that the hall coefficient of all conditions of Co-NiO films is positive, revealing the characteristic of p-type semiconductors. Meanwhile, the increase in Co concentration from 0.05  to 0.1 M improves the carrier concentration of Co-NiO films. Nevertheless, the carrier concentration of Co-NiO films reduced at the concentration of Co higher than 0.1 M. This result corresponds to the increase of resistivity. To illustrate that the Co-NiO film by sparking under the uniform magnetic field can be practically used as the transparent conductor, 0.1 M Co-NiO film was connected with a blue light-emitting diode (LED) supplied by the voltage of 5 V and current of 14 mA as shown in Fig. 7d. The comparison between ITO and 0.1 M Co-NiO indicates that the resistivity and the carrier concentration of 0.1 M Co-NiO differ from ITO by ~ 1 to 2 orders of magnitude42,43.\n",
            "         617 In this work, the Co-NiO film was successfully deposited by the two steps, which the first step is the deposition of NiO film by spark discharge under the uniform magnetic field and the second step is the spin coating of Co solution on NiO film. The increase in Co concentration from 0.05  to 0.1 M helps to improve the crystallinity and increases the carrier concentration of NiO film, resulting in a decrease of resistivity. This consequence is in agreement with the increase in the number of higher-valence Ni3+ because of the Co2+ substituted Ni2+, which confirms our assumption. By considering with optical and electrical properties, 0.05 M Co-NiO film is promising applications in TCO.\n",

            "         628 Abundance profiling via 16S rRNA targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) is a common procedure to characterize mixtures of prokaryotic populations inhabiting an environment. Depending on the variable region/s addressed, different maps can be obtained due to their different information content. In this work, we focussed on wastewater microbial communities and we compared several recently developed universal primers that addressed regions V1-V3, V3-V4 and V4. They all proved to have good performance over a wide range of microbial phyla, but the phylum Planctomycetes was not optimally covered, especially for members of the Brocadiales family. Such bacteria are at the basis of the novel nitrogen removal strategy based on anammox process. To overcome this limitation we performed an extensive bioinformatic analysis that allowed the design of a primer (Pro341FB) that shows increased sensitivity for this specific phylum with respect to the previously proposed Pro341F primer. Upon validation using a 16S NGS survey on microbial communities from different wastewater treatment plant (activated sludge systems, anaerobic digesters, aerobic and anaerobic granules) we demonstrated that Pro341FB is able to reveal up to 5 times more members of the Candidatus Brocadiales family (plus many other previously under-covered prokaryotes) than Pro341F, without affecting its excellent previous coverage.\n",
            "         648 In order to verify the increase in performances for anammox communities by our modified forward primer Pro341FB, we collected the microbial community samples from 5 different origins, namely activated sludges from a domestic WWTP plant (SCS), activated sludges from a tannery WWTP (CDS), aerobic granular sludge (AGS), and partial nitrification anammox granular sludge (PNA) from pilot scale reactors fed with domestic wastewater. For the two former plants, samples from their anaerobic digestion reactors were also collected (SCD and CDD, respectively). The samples were collected from bioreactors operated in widely different conditions (suspended vs biofilm and aerobic/anoxic vs anaerobic) and fed with various substrates, in order to allow the validation of the protocol in most of the selective conditions typical for microbial communities in wastewater treatment. The total DNA of all communities was extracted and amplicons were generated using the primer pairs Pro341F + Pro805R or Pro341FB + Pro805R. As shown in Fig. 4, NGS revealed that the percentage of identified phyla was almost the same in all samples but in the PNA, where anammox communities were largely underestimated by Pro341F with respect to Pro341FB. As a confirmation it has been recently reported that anammox species largely dominate the granule population1, underlining the underestimation by the original Pro341F primer.\n",
            "         653 In conclusion, the improvement in coverage for anammox species brought by our novel primers will be of great benefit, also considering that anammox-based denitrification is considered a novel and promising strategy in the field of wastewater treatment.\n",

            "         664 Incorporating optical cavities in ion traps is becoming increasingly important in the development of photonic quantum networks. However, the presence of the cavity can hamper efficient laser cooling of ions because of geometric constraints that the cavity imposes and an unfavourable Purcell effect that can modify the cooling dynamics substantially. On the other hand the coupling of the ion to the cavity can also be exploited to provide a mechanism to efficiently cool the ion. In this paper we demonstrate experimentally how cavity cooling can be implemented to improve the localisation of the ion and thus its coupling to the cavity. By using cavity cooling we obtain an enhanced ion–cavity coupling of 2π×(16.7±0.1) MHz, compared with 2π×(15.2±0.1) MHz when using only Doppler cooling.\n",
            "         666 While the optical cavity is crucial to facilitate the ion–light interaction, its presence can interfere with the manipulation of the ion. In particular laser cooling can be hindered by the Purcell effect11. This can be circumvented by choosing cooling transitions within the ion that are not affected by the cavity3. Alternatively, the ion–cavity interaction can be exploited to improve the cooling process. Cooling of trapped ions by using their interaction with an optical cavity has been theoretically studied extensively in the weak binding regime12,13,14,15,16, where the transition linewidth is larger than the secular frequencies. Cavity sideband cooling in the strong binding regime has been studied both theoretically17 and experimentally18,19.\n",
            "         674 While the coherent coupling is optimal at the antinode of the cavity field, the emission of the ion into the mode results in heating of the ion’s motion along the cavity axis. For optimal axial cavity cooling, the ion’s position must be moved to the node of the cavity field22. To probe the ion when it is maximally coupled to the cavity while still benefiting from efficient cavity cooling, the ion must be moved from the node, where it is cooled, to the antinode where it is probed. For this purpose, a dual channel arbitrary function generator (DAFG) provides voltages to the upper and lower electrodes to shuttle the ion. In this case we avoid introducing a static quadrupole by applying the same signal to the two inner electrodes but with an opposite sign. The ion is transferred adiabatically in order to avoid motional excitation. To this end, the signal applied to the rf ground electrodes follows a Blackman-Nuttal window (BNW) shape, the amplitude of which can be tuned to precisely shuttle the ion from a node to any desired point in the standing wave (Fig. 2). The shuttling voltage is summed with the dc micromotion compensation voltage and applied to the inner electrodes. Low pass filters are used to reduce electrical noise from the summing amplifier and block the rf signal coming from the trap. An example of the shape of the shuttling signal can be seen in Fig. 3.\n",
            "         676 Cavity cooling implementation\n",
            "         677 For cavity cooling, a laser on the S1/2↔P1/2transition (pump laser) is tuned close to Raman resonance with the cavity on the P1/2↔D3/2transition. Simultaneously applying lasers on the D3/2↔P3/2and D5/2↔P3/2transitions provides re-pumping of the ion back into the S1/2state, completing the cycle for continuous emission of photons into the cavity. The laser on the S1/2↔P1/2transition is red-detuned with respect to the atomic resonance and hence provides Doppler cooling. However, due to the almost perpendicular alignment of the laser with respect to the cavity axis, Doppler cooling along the cavity axis is inefficient.\n",
            "         678 The cavity, together with the pump laser, forms a Raman transition between the S1/2and the D3/2states. When the ion is moved to a node of the cavity field, this Raman transition couples not only the internal state of the ion but also to the ion’s axial motion22. Tuning the cavity blue with respect to the Raman resonance leads to a net reduction of the motional excitation of the ion, similar to Raman sideband cooling. Hence, the emission of a cavity photon leads to a reduction in the motional state excitation of the ion12. In order to measure the improvement of the ion’s localisation due to the cavity cooling process we use the standing wave pattern measured by the cavity emission from the ion, similarly to Ref.7. Increase in the visibility indicates an increase in the ion’s localisation.\n",
            "         679 Laser pulses and shuttling voltage pulse of the experimental sequence. (I) Cavity cooling of the ion at the node. (II) Adiabatic shuttling of the ion to the new position and state preparation to the 42S1/2 state. (III) Single photon emission in the cavity by driving the Raman transition. Photons are detected by a single-photon counting module (SPCM) connected to the output of the fibre cavity. (IV) Adiabatic return of the ion to the node.\n",
            "         680 To map the standing wave pattern the following experimental sequence is applied (Fig. 3). The ion is initially placed at the node of the cavity mode and the lasers on the S1/2↔P1/2, D3/2↔P3/2and D5/2↔P3/2transitions are applied. The cavity is blue-detuned relative to the nominal Raman resonance to facilitate cavity cooling. After the cooling period the laser on the S1/2↔P1/2transition is extinguished to prepare the ion in the S1/2state, and then the ion is adiabatically shuttled to the new position. At the new position a probe laser produces a single photon in the cavity using a cavity-assisted Raman resonance. The cavity emission is recorded with a single-photon detector that is gated during the probe laser pulse. There is a 1.7 μs delay before the single photon detection in order to eliminate the effect of transient voltages in the shuttling process. The ion is probed for 300 ns. The sequence is concluded by adiabatically shuttling the ion back to the node of the cavity field while repumping with the lasers on the D3/2↔P3/2and D5/2↔P3/2transitions. This sequence operates at a rate of 91 kHz. Scanning the final position of the ion after cooling, by varying the amplitude of the shuttling pulse, provides the position-dependent photon emission probability. The sequence was repeated 180,000 times at each final position and the errors were extracted from the variations between the measurements.\n",
            "         681 In order to optimise the cavity cooling process, the relevant parameters (cavity detuning, length of periods I–IV (see Fig. 3), cooling beam and probing beam Rabi frequencies) are individually varied. While the cavity detuning, cooling laser parameters and cooling duration affect the ion’s final temperature during the cavity cooling phase, the duration of the shuttling period can also contribute to heating of the ion and can lead to significantly reduced localization. We find a visibility of only 56±1% for a shuttling period of 0.5 μs which improves with increasing length and saturates for ≥1.5μs to 78±1%. This indicates that the increase in the ion’s motional excitation during shuttling is negligible for periods longer than 1.5 μs. Figure 4 shows the fitted final standing wave scan (blue trace), after all the parameters were optimised. The best periods for cooling, shuttling and probing the ion can be seen in Fig. 3. The Rabi frequencies are 2π×14.0 MHz for the cooling 397 nm beam and 2π×11.8 MHz for the probing 397 nm beam. In addition, for optimal cavity cooling the cavity is blue-detuned 7.0 MHz from the nominal Raman resonance (Δp). In the same figure we plot a fitted standing wave scan (red trace) where, instead of cavity cooling, during the same period, the ion is Doppler cooled on the S1/2↔P3/2transition, such that the cavity does not influence the Doppler cooling process. The 393 nm laser on the S1/2↔P3/2transition has the same angle to the cavity axis as the 397 nm cooling laser and has a similar Doppler cooling efficiency. From Fig. 4 we can see the improvement that cavity cooling has on the visibility and thus the localisation of the ion. The standing wave pattern measurements are normalised to the maximum emission rate. For Doppler cooling (red trace) the signal to noise ratio was low, because of the delocalisation of the ion due to inefficient cooling, which resulted in big error bars.\n",
            "         686 With cavity cooling we can improve the localisation of the ion along the cavity axis, which means that a stronger ion–cavity coupling can be achieved. To quantify the increase of the ion–cavity coupling, we measure it with and without cavity cooling using the method described in Ref.3. The coupling of the ion to the cavity has the effect of shifting the Raman resonance condition by an amount dependent on the coupling. An example of this effect is shown in Fig. 5. In this case the cavity emission is measured as the cavity is scanned across the Raman resonance while the probe detuning is fixed at Δp=−10 MHz. The Raman resonance is expected at the condition where the cavity detuning is the same as the probe detuning Δp=Δc, but instead it has been shifted by an amount δ, as can be seen in Fig. 5.\n",
            "         688 Laser pulses and shuttling voltage pulse during one cycle. (I) State preparation to the 42S1/2 state followed by measurement of the cavity transmission of a laser beam tuned on resonance with the 866 nm atomic transition for reference. Photons are collected by a gated SPCM. (II) Cavity cooling for 6 μs with the cavity detuned from the nominal Raman resonance by +7 MHz. (III) Adiabatic shuttling of the ion to the antinode and state preparation. (IV) Generation of a single photon and collection of photons by a gated SPCM. (V) Adiabatic return of the ion to the node with additional Doppler cooling with a 393 nm laser.\n",
            "         689 To scan the cavity across the Raman resonance while using the cavity cooling technique we use the pulse sequence displayed in Fig. 6. Initially, the ion is prepared in the S1/2state, which decouples the ion from the cavity. The cavity transmission is then measured with an 866 nm laser that is tuned to the atomic transition. In this way the reference point of the cavity detuning (Δc=0) is determined. This is followed by a cavity cooling period, where the cavity is blue detuned by 7 MHz from the nominal Raman resonance (this is the optimal cavity detuning for maximising cavity cooling efficiency). The ion is then shuttled adiabatically from the node to the antinode whilst simultaneously preparing the ion in the ground state. This is followed by the single photon generation and detection of the cavity emission via a gated single-photon counting module. Finally, the ion is moved back to the node while simultaneously being Doppler cooled on the S1/2↔P3/2transition. This pulse sequence is repeated as the cavity is scanned across the Raman resonance. As the cavity is scanned during this measurement the cooling beam frequency is varied to keep the detuning of the cavity from the nominal Raman resonance with the cooling beam constant.\n",
            "         690 We repeat this Raman spectroscopy for different probe detunings, to measure how δ changes. Plotting the shift δ against the probe detuning exhibits a dispersion-like profile. The spectrum is simulated using an 8-level model of a static 40Ca+ion and a bimodal cavity and used to extract the shift δ for each probe detuning (see Ref.3 for details). In this simulation, the only free parameter is the coherent ion–cavity coupling g0. The ion’s motion is assumed to lead to an averaged coherent coupling due to its excursion from the anti-node of the ion–cavity coupling. In Fig. 7 we plot the traces of the simulation for different g0 values. Using this model as a map we fit to our experimental data and extract the effective coherent ion–cavity coupling. The measured coupling without cavity cooling is 2π×(15.2±0.1) MHz (see Fig. 7). When including a period of cavity cooling in the sequence (Fig. 6), the coherent ion–cavity coupling increases to 2π×(16.7±0.1) MHz. With the expected ion–cavity coupling for a perfectly localised ion of 2π×17.3 MHz and assuming that the reduced localisation is only due to the ion’s thermal motion, we calculated that the addition of the cavity cooling step reduces the spread of the ion’s position from Δz=110 nm to Δz=55 nm. Using Δz≈2kBTmω2sec−−−−√24 with the ion’s mass m, its temperature T and its secular frequency ωsec, the corresponding temperature reduces from 8.5 to 2.1 mK. We have increased the measured ion–cavity coupling from 87% of the theoretically possible ion–cavity coupling with Doppler cooling to 97% with the introduction of cavity cooling.\n",
            "         694 In conclusion, we have demonstrated that an optical cavity can be used to significantly improve the localisation of the ion. By exploiting the strong ion–cavity coupling for cavity cooling instead of circumventing its effect on the laser cooling, we have been able to improve the localisation of the ion in the cavity and thus the effective ion–cavity coupling. While the ion–cavity coupling in our system is limited to 2π×(15.2±0.1) MHz by Doppler cooling, we can achieve 2π×(16.7±0.1) MHz when employing cavity cooling. This corresponds to 97% of the maximally achievable coupling in our system. Notably, this is the highest ion–cavity coupling achieved for a single ion in the strong coupling regime.\n",

            "         695 Lung disease is common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The onset of lung involvement in RA is not well known. The objective is to describe the features and evolution of lung involvement in early RA, its relationship with disease activity parameters, smoking and treatments. Consecutive patients with early RA without respiratory symptoms were included and tracked for 5 years. Lung assessment included clinical, radiological and pulmonary function tests at diagnosis and during follow-up. Peripheral blood parameters (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide autoantibodies) and scales of articular involvement, such as DAS28-CRP, were evaluated. 40 patients were included and 32 completed the 5-year follow up. 13 patients presented lung involvement in the initial 5 years after RA diagnosis, 3 of them interstitial lung disease. Significant decrease of diffusion lung transfer capacity of carbon monoxide over time was observed in six patients, 2 of them developed interstitial lung disease. DLCO decrease was correlated with higher values of CRP and ESR at diagnosis. Methotrexate was not associated with DLCO deterioration or lung disease development. Subclinical progressive lung disease correlates with RA activity parameters. Smoking status and methotrexate were not associated with development or progression of lung disease.\n",
            "         722 In this single-center prospective cohort study of patients with early RA, we demonstrate that the systematic lung evaluation, including HRCT and DLCO, allows the identification of respiratory abnormalities in more than one-third of cases, most of them without symptoms. On the other hand, disease activity measured through scales and serum acute phase markers decreased after 5 years of follow up in most cases. This can be attributed to a better control of the inflammatory process associated to the treatment, as previously reported13.\n",
            "         725 Our results suggest that lung disease may be identified at diagnosis and in the first years after RA diagnosis. Airway involvement is not uncommon in RA patients, especially in the form of bronchiectasis and/or bronchiolitis7. In our cohort these patients presented clinical and functional stability after 5 years and did not associate an increased risk of mortality, which differs from previous data27,28. However, respiratory infections could be more frequent in these cases after years and in the context of some biological treatments. Up to 6.3% of our cohort developed clinically significant ILD. Though radiological findings in the first years of RA are variable and non-specific as described in previous studies4,5,7,24,25,26, ILD can develop in early RA3. Clinically significant RA-ILD has been observed on average in 8 to 10% of patients with RA3,29,30,31. Therefore, ILD may develop at any time of the rheumatologic disease and, when no systematic evaluation is performed from RA diagnosis, ILD can not be certainly attributed to the disease or the treatment. Finally, an optimized management and early treatment of RA-ILD could change this less than optimal progression.\n",

The distribution and composition of chemical elements and phases of PEO coatings were analyzed by an orthogonal experiment, and the formation mechanism of PEO coatings was discussed. The corrosion current densities and corrosion potentials were measured. The results indicated that the formation of a transition layer mainly containing Fe3O4 was crucial for achieving an excellent coating quality. Furthermore, the corrosion current density of coated steel was reduced by 78% compared with the bare steel.\n",
            "         730 The plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) is one of the most promising techniques to fabricate anticorrosive coating for the LCS pipeline1. The PEO is widely used to fabricate functional coatings on light metals and their alloys, such as Al, Mg, and Ti9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. During PEO processes, the substrate of samples does not endure a high thermal load. Because the arc discharge only happens in localized zones and remains for a very short period17. Meanwhile, the requirement of pretreatments for PEO is not strict due to the high energy of the plasma arc. Furthermore, the PEO can achieve metallic bonding between the substrate and coatings18. Therefore, the PEO is suitable to carry out inside surface anti-corrosion treatment for ship LCS pipes.\n",
            "         732 For ship LCS pipes, the ceramic coatings composed of iron oxide and aluminum oxide are not suitable for corrosion protection against acid environment. For example, it is necessary to have excellent acid corrosion resistance for the wastewater pipes of scrubbers on ships. As well known, SiO2 coating has excellent corrosion resistance against acid. However, the preparation of SiO2 ceramic coatings has not been studied thoroughly; the fabrication process and formation mechanism of SiO2 coatings are not clear. The barriers constraint the application of PEO technology in the surface treatment of low carbon steel.\n",
            "         733 In this work, an orthogonal experiment was employed to thoroughly analyze the preparation process and formation mechanism of the SiO2 PEO coating, which is significant for further promotion of the SiO2 coating. The relationship of main PEO electric parameters, chemical composition and compactness of the PEO coatings is firstly revealed. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) mapping and Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectrometer (GDOES) were performed for chemical composition analysis of PEO coatings. Finally, the corrosion resistance of PEO coatings was evaluated.\n",
            "         758 The main peaks in Fig. 5 are for Fe. Because the PEO coatings are relatively thin, the X-ray already reaches the substrate of samples. Apart from the peaks for Fe, there are several weak peaks for Fe2O3, Fe3O4, FeO, Fe2SiO4, and SiO2. As the peaks have much lower intensity, these phases do not have high crystallinity, and the grains dimension are relatively small. Therefore, the PEO coatings are a kind of non-crystalline coatings. It is observed in Fig. 5 that there is a small bread peak at around 2θ = 25° in the XRD curve of sample 3 and 7. The bread peaks are ascribed to amorphous SiO2. However, bread peaks are not detected in the curves of sample 8, 13, and 16. Furthermore, there are several lower peaks of SiO2 in the XRD patterns of sample 8, 13, and 16. Therefore, the PEO coatings prepared in Test 8, 13, and 16 have higher crystallinity. Moreover, the XRD curve of sample 8 contains higher intensity of peaks than the other curves, for instance, at around 2θ = 65.2° there is a peak for Fe3O4, which has the highest intensity of Fe3O4 peaks. Thus, the PEO coating produced in Test 8 has the highest crystallinity among these coatings. This is one reason for the PEO coating produced by Test 8 exhibiting relatively excellent surface morphology and adhesion condition.\n",
            "         767 The corrosion current density of the PEO coating of Test 8 is 52.6 μA/cm2, and its corrosion potential is − 0.693 V. The Q235 steel substrate has a corrosion current density of 244 μA/cm2, and a corrosion potential of − 0.983 V. After the PEO treatment, the corrosion potential of Q235 steel moves to a noble direction; meanwhile, the corrosion current density of PEO coating is 22% of bare Q235 sample. Therefore, the anti-corrosion property of Q235 steel is greatly improved by PEO surface treatments.\n",
            "         768 In this work, a non-crystalline anticorrosive coating was prepared on Q235 low carbon steel by PEO. To promote the application of this technology in engineering practice and improve the coating quality, the coating-forming mechanism, elements and phase composition of the PEO coatings were analyzed deeply by an orthogonal experiment. The results indicated that:\n",

            "         777 The Younger Dryas (YD) is recognized as a cool period that began and ended abruptly during a time of general warming at the end of the last glacial. New multi-proxy data from a sediment gravity core from Storfjordrenna (western Barents Sea, 253 m water depth) reveals that the onset of the YD occurred as a single short-lived dramatic environment deterioration, whereas the subsequent warming was oscillatory. The water masses in the western Barents Sea were likely strongly stratified at the onset of the YD, possibly due to runoff of meltwater combined with perennial sea-ice cover, the latter may last up to several decades without any brake-up. Consequently, anoxic conditions prevailed at the bottom of Storfjordrenna, leading to a sharp reduction of benthic biota and the appearance of vivianite microconcretions which formation is favoured by reducing conditions. While the anoxic conditions in Storfjordrenna were transient, the unfavorable conditions for benthic foraminifera lasted for c. 1300 years. We suggest that the Pre-Boreal Oscillation, just after the onset of the Holocene, may have been a continuation of the oscillatory warming trend during the YD.\n",
            "         781 An earlier study of sediment gravity core JM09-020-GC from Storfjordrenna (western Barents Sea; Fig. 1) revealed that the YD was not uniformly cold as had earlier been proposed and that at least some warmer periods occurred13. In this paper, we present a new multi-proxy record of the YD from core JM09-020-GC with higher temporal resolution than that presented in Łącka et al.13 consisting of sedimentological (ice-rafted debris counts), mineralogical (analyses of vivianite), micropaleontological (benthic foraminifera counts) and geochemical (Mn/Fe, oxygen stable isotopes, composition of microconcretions) analyses and we compare our results to other paleoclimatic records. Our new findings, as well as new data concerning the Arctic Ocean circulation at that time, prompted us to resume the discussion on the YD trigger and its evolution. The aim of this study is to provide a more detailed understanding of the oceanographic variability that occurred in the western Barents Sea during this stadial.\n",
            "         798 We have demonstrated that the onset of the YD in the western Barents Sea was likely much more dramatic than is generally inferred. Because the Bering Strait was locked or partly opened at that time, the only effective meltwater outflow from the Arctic Ocean was through the Fram Strait and the Barents Sea (Fig. 4). Perennial sea-ice cover in the western Barents Sea was most likely formed as a consequence of the slowdown and westward migration of the AMOC. Along with the likely significant glacial meltwater supply, the strong stratification in Storfjordrenna supported anoxic seafloor conditions for approximately a century at the onset of YD. Throughout YD, several similar abrupt coolings occurred synchronously with SST warming in Baffin Bay. We suggest that the last of such periods was the Pre-Boreal Oscillation just after the onset of the Holocene. However, the scarcity of high-resolution and well-dated records from the discussed time periods and inevitable dating uncertainties, limit our understanding of the overall oceanography during these abrupt reversals. Our study shows the relevance of high temporal resolution studies of marine sediment records to identify, as well as to understand the magnitudes and consequences of short-lasting environmental changes.\n",
